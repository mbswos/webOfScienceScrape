With the release of dashboard extensions in Tableau 2018.2, we're unleashing the creativity and problem-solving skills of passionate developers to make extensions for Tableau dashboards. Hereâ€™s your roadmap towards designing great extensions.

### Who is this document for?

This document is focused on guiding developers towards best practices for designing extensions, including both user interaction and visual style guidelines.

### What are Dashboard Extensions?

Tableau Dashboard Extensions are web applications that have two-way communication with the dashboard. Dashboard extensions enable all sorts of scenarios, like letting you integrate Tableau with custom applications, making possible for you to modify the data for a visualization, or even creating custom visualizations inside the dashboard. 



### How to use this document

These guidelines cover the main things you need to know about designing a great extension experience. This document is organized in three parts.
