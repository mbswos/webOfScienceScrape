Naming Conventions:
	- The following conventions must be followed to avoid miss used of then code

	Main Naming Patterns:
	- Folder Names: PascalCase
	- File Names: alllowercase
	- Classes: PascalCase
	- Methods: under_score
	- Functions: under_score
	- Variables: under_score
	- SQL queries: UPPERCASE_UNDER_SCORE
	- Table Names: UPPERCASE_UNDER_SCORE

	Class Naming Patterns:
	- dbconnection.DBConnection() variables should be stored as connection
	- connection.storer variables should be stored as storer
	- connection.querier variables should be stored as querier

	File Naming Patterns:
	- tablesetupscript.py has variable names follow the under_score naming convention
		- Variable name = lowercase(table name) + _table_sql

	Unnamed Conventions:
	- If there isn't a naming convention mentioned above, just follow what is currently being done. Pay attention to file names, capitalization, and spacing.

	Exceptions:
	- RMPClass in RateMyProfessorsScrape does not follow any naming conventions layed out in this file as it was an imported class from github.
