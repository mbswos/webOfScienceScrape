The model is predicated on two central ideas. The first is that leadership is intrinsically an emotional process, where leaders display emotion and attempt to evoke emotion in their members. The second is that leadership is a process of social interaction and is therefore appropriately defined in terms of social, psychological theories such as the attribution theory. Our focus is on the perspective of members, not the leaders. Specifically, members\' attributions about their leader\'s intentions influence how the members evaluate, interpret, and eventually label the leader\'s influence attempts as either “true” or “pseudo” transformational leadership. These attributions are determined by and themselves influence the members\' emotions.

That it has become a standard concept in general and applied psychology, as well as in applied business settings, is indubitable. Is this popularity warranted? Casting a shadow over the concept of emotional intelligence are concerns about its meaningfulness and the construct and predictive validity of its various measures. The following series of letters explores various issues surrounding emotional intelligence and leadership including: whether emotional intelligence is theoretically needed for leadership, the types of emotional intelligence tests that may hold the most promise, methodological standards for testing whether emotional intelligence matters, evidence from the neuroscience literature on emotions and intelligence, and evidence regarding the links between leader emotional intelligence and follower outcomes.</div></div></div></div></div>', 'author': 'John Antonakis and Neal M Ashkanasy and Marie T Dasborough', 'eprint': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1048984309000174', 'journal': 'The Leadership Quarterly', 'number': '2', 'pages': '247-261', 'publisher': 'JAI', 'title': 'Does leadership need emotional intelligence?', 'url': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1048984309000174', 'volume': '20', 'year': 2009}, 'citedby': 507, 'id_citations': '8ss8qzcAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '8475566237415998902', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div><div><div class="gsh_csp">This article is predicated on the idea that leaders shape workplace affective events.

Consistent with this theory, employees are more likely to recall negative incidents than positive incidents. In a qualitative study, evidence that these processes exist in the workplace was found.

These are in turn reflected in the group\'s affective climate and trust climate, and also in the quality of leader-member and team-member relationships.

We argue that the intraindividual paradigm challenges scholars to rethink what they mean by stability, concluding that stability can be conceptualized in two ways—as reasonably consistent levels of affect and predictable patterns of affective change.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Russell Cropanzano and Marie T Dasborough', 'eprint': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Russell_Cropanzano/publication/282155505_Dynamic_Models_of_Well-Being_Implications_of_Affective_Events_Theory_for_Expanding_Current_Views_on_Personality_and_Climate/links/560568c908ae5e8e3f3252bf/Dynamic-Models-of-Well-Being-Implications-of-Affective-Events-Theory-for-Expanding-Current-Views-on-Personality-and-Climate.pdf', 'journal': 'European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology', 'number': '6', 'pages': '844-847', 'publisher': 'Routledge', 'title': 'Dynamic models of well-being: Implications of affective events theory for expanding current views on personality and climate', 'url': 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1359432X.2015.1072245', 'volume': '24', 'year': 2015}, 'citedby': 25, 'id_citations': '8ss8qzcAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C', 'id_scholarcitedby': '15883684761173634287', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"> <div class="gsh_csp">Workplace entitlement is a pressing concern for modern organizations and managers.

The study represents a preliminary test of a model based on Affective Events Theory, which posits that leaders who are seen to be effective shape the affective events that determine employees\' attitudes and behaviours in the workplace. Within this framework, we argue that effective leaders ameliorate employees\' hassles by providing frequent, small emotional uplifts. The resulting positive affective states are then proposed to lead to more positive employee attitudes and behaviours, and more positive regard for the leader. Importantly, leaders who demonstrate these ameliorating behaviours are likely to require high levels of emotional intelligence, defined in terms of the ability to recognise, understand, and manage emotions in self and others.

As a socially undesirable emotion, it might be assumed that individuals would be hesitant to share their schadenfreude. In two experimental studies involving emotional responses to unethical behaviors, we find evidence to the contrary. Study 1 revealed that subjects experiencing schadenfreude were willing to share their feelings, especially if the misfortune was perceived to be deserved (i.e., resulting from unethical behaviors). Study 2 extends this work by incorporating schadenfreude targets of different status (CEO versus employee). Consistent with the “tall poppy syndrome,” subjects were more willing to share schadenfreude concerning high status targets than low status targets when the perceived severity of the target’s …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Marie Dasborough and Paul Harvey', 'eprint': 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-016-3060-7', 'journal': 'Journal of Business Ethics', 'number': '4', 'pages': '693-707', 'publisher': 'Springer Netherlands', 'title': 'Schadenfreude: The (not so) secret joy of another’s misfortune', 'url': 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-016-3060-7', 'volume': '141', 'year': 2017}, 'citedby': 17, 'id_citations': '8ss8qzcAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '9507810863410947187', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Accumulating evidence suggests that Team-member exchange (TMX) influences employee work attitudes and behaviours separately from the effects of leader-member exchange (LMX).

To explore this phenomenon, this chapter presents a multi-level model of TMX in organizations, which incorporates LMX differentiation, team identification, team member affect at the individual level, and fairness of LMX differentiation and affective climate at the group-level.

In this chapter we discuss the implications of the pervasiveness of emotion in organizations from the point of view of learning and education, with an emphasis on the role of emotions and emotional intelligence training in leadership programs. To accomplish this, we first define emotions, and then we review the recent literature on emotions as it pertains to organizational settings. In particular, the controversial notion of emotional intelligence has attained wide prominence, especially in the practitioner literature (eg, Goleman, 1998), so we deal with this topic in some depth in this chapter, including a definition of emotional intelligence, discussion of the ongoing controversy, and elucidation of the role of emotion intelligence in the context of leadership. We then discuss issues surrounding emotional intelligence teaching, and specifically discuss how emotional skills may assist in the development of organizational leadership skills. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of emotions and emotional intelligence for management learning and education, and discuss some directions for the future development of this field.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Neal M Ashkanasy and Marie T Dasborough and Kaylene W Ascough', 'journal': 'The Sage handbook of management learning, education and development', 'pages': '161-183', 'publisher': 'Sage', 'title': 'Developing leaders: Teaching about emotional intelligence and training in emotional skills', 'url': 'http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=Om3nZSDGKNUC&oi=fnd&pg=PA161&dq=info:zVF2vrvG55wJ:scholar.google.com&ots=vshs_jJ9ni&sig=OywM9_GJhiOBTVaFrY7T6Ag_svc', 'year': 2009}, 'citedby': 10, 'id_citations': '8ss8qzcAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '11306223899193528781', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">A Critique of Emotional Intelligence: What Are the Problems and How Can They Be Fixed?, edited by Kevin R.

Ostensibly, authentic leaders with high power values seem to represent the dark side of authentic leadership.

More recently, as the field has further matured, we are seeing a new focus on discrete emotions, and on moral emotions in particular (see Lindebaum et al., 2017). Moral emotions are defined as those which function as a type of moral barometer; they provide immediate and salient feedback on social and moral acceptability (Tangney et al., 2007). We agree that the study of moral emotions is critical to promote ethical behavior in organizations, yet we have concerns about how they are sometimes represented as being purely positive or negative in nature.</div><div class="gsh_csp">We aim to add new insights to the current debates in the literature on the oversimplification of emotions (Lindebaum and Jordan, 2012, 2014). To illustrate our concerns about simplified views of emotions, we focus specifically on the moral emotion of schadenfreude. Our motivation for this chapter is to highlight the complexities of this specific moral emotion, especially in the case of talking about it with others. Talking about schadenfreude (eg, verbalizing, sharing) can have reputational effects, for both the target and the source, that are distinct from its intended social functions (Dasborough and Harvey, 2017). As we will discuss in the following sections, there are pros and cons to sharing schadenfreude with others. Rather than viewing it as a purely positive or negative moral emotion, we urge scholars to consider the various ways in which it may be perceived by others. Our chapter is structured as follows. First, we define schadenfreude …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Paul Harvey and Marie T Dasborough', 'publisher': 'Edward Elgar Publishing', 'title': 'Talking about schadenfreude: sharing versus the social function', 'url': 'http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=i6FyDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA211&dq=info:O-mztfsXx1oJ:scholar.google.com&ots=J-rPtBOacW&sig=gYXJY_KZ8mWqVbhI-aWh6wdnW7s', 'year': 2018}, 'citedby': 1, 'id_citations': '8ss8qzcAAAAJ:nrtMV_XWKgEC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '6541223353631631675', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">" Please check your email for instructions on resetting your password.

We then explore these mechanisms further by proposing negative affect and mindfulness as two important underlying processes that help explain the emergence of conflict in teams with abusive supervision.

The affective reactions of employees in response to workplace events is a topic of substantial importance to managers and researchers alike. Positive emotional reactions have been linked to numerous desirable outcomes such as increased productivity, job satisfaction and empowerment, and decreased stress and turnover. Conversely, negative emotional reactions have been shown to predict a wide array of undesirable outcomes such as tension, turnover, decreased productivity and even workplace violence (Bagozzi, 2003). However, we argue that our current understanding of the relationships between affect and behavioral outcomes is incomplete.

Furthermore, we argue that escalation of subgroup perceptions and its effects on participation in shared leadership depend on the level of task interdependence and individual’s identification with the team.

Drawing from resource conservation theory and social exchange theory, we suggest that when there is both high mean and high variation of abusive supervision within a team, high levels of TMX can lead to lower creativity because of depletion of limited socio-emotional resources, as well as fights over those types of limited resources. We also predict that when abusive supervision differentiation is high, low TMX is likely to help overcome and even reverse the negative effects of high mean abusive supervision on creativity in teams.

This framework is not typically used to shed light on the evolution of emotions because emotions are not themselves behaviors.[1] I have previously argued, however, that the huge amount of literature from evolutionary game theory on the evolution of cooperation, altruism, and apology can be used to study the evolution of guilt by showing where and when guilt can provide individual fitness benefits to actors by dint of causing adaptive behaviors (O’Connor, 2016). In that paper, and in subsequent evolutionary game theoretic work, Sarita Rosenstock and I have focused in particular on potential benefits accruing to guilt-prone individuals as the result of costly apology (Rosenstock and O’Connor, ms).</div><div class="gsh_csp">In this article, I will summarize findings from these papers. As I will point out, there are three main sets of results in evolutionary game theory that shed light on the evolution of guilt. First, work on altruism in the prisoner’s dilemma game indicates that in environments where actors engage in reciprocation and punishment, guilt can provide individual benefits by promoting altruism. Second, work on the stag hunt shows that when actors are in groups of relatively cooperative partners, and especially when they are engaged in repeated interactions with neighbors, guilt can promote fitness by leading to cooperation. And lastly, results on costly apology show that, perhaps unintuitively, paying costs can allow actors to successfully apologize and to reap the cooperative benefits of doing so. These findings do not fully explain …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Ronald de Sousa and Joseph Campos and James Averill and Martha Nussbaum and Jim Russell and Jennifer Lerner and Justin D’Arms and Phoebe Ellsworth and Klaus Scherer and Lisa Feldman Barrett and Nico Frijda and Paul Ekman and Joe LeDoux and Derek Matravers and Alexandra Main and Jodi Halpern and George Marcus and Jason Brennan and Kathleen Searles and Travis Ridout and Samuel Justin Sinclair', 'eprint': 'http://emotionresearcher.com/guilt-games-and-evolution/', 'title': 'Guilt, Games, and Evolution', 'url': 'http://emotionresearcher.com/guilt-games-and-evolution/'}, 'id_citations': '8ss8qzcAAAAJ:PR6Y55bgFSsC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">May 2016–Humans rely on social relationships and cultural systems for survival and wellbeing. Harming or neglecting one’s relationship partners can have dire consequences. Guilt is an aversive emotion that discourages behaviors that could threaten one’s ability to get along with others. The experience of guilt can lead people to repair their relationships and learn from their mistakes; the anticipation of guilt can prevent people from damaging their relationships. Therefore, anticipated guilt is particularly functional. Guilt can be elicited by: 1) transgressing against others, 2) failing to self-regulate, or 3) causing resentment among others even when such resentment is not one’s fault (eg, being resented by friends for receiving unfair rewards). Anticipating any of these can also cause guilt. The motivation to minimize guilty feelings can lead people derogate their victims or deny their culpability. More importantly, it can lead people to make amends with their relationship partners and avoid behaviors that might harm their relationships.</div><div class="gsh_csp">In what follows, we will address three main issues: the nature of guilt, the functions of guilt, and the management of guilty feelings. As we will argue, guilt helps people to maintain and enhance their relationships with others.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Ronald de Sousa and Joseph Campos and James Averill and Martha Nussbaum and Jim Russell and Jennifer Lerner and Justin D’Arms and Phoebe Ellsworth and Klaus Scherer and Lisa Feldman Barrett and Nico Frijda and Paul Ekman and Joe LeDoux and Derek Matravers and Alexandra Main and Jodi Halpern and George Marcus and Jason Brennan and Kathleen Searles and Travis Ridout and Samuel Justin Sinclair', 'eprint': 'https://emotionresearcher.com/the-functions-of-guilt/', 'title': 'The Functions of Guilt', 'url': 'https://emotionresearcher.com/the-functions-of-guilt/'}, 'id_citations': '8ss8qzcAAAAJ:1yQoGdGgb4wC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">mayer 2 John (Jack) D.

The concept was subsequently popularized by New York Times journalist Daniel Goleman (1995), whose book, Emotional intelligence: Why it can matter more than IQ, became a bestseller and was even featured on the cover of Time Magazine. Mayer and Salovey (1997) later refined their definition into the “four branch” model, which involves four abilities:</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Ronald de Sousa and Joseph Campos and James Averill and Martha Nussbaum and Jim Russell and Jennifer Lerner and Justin D’Arms and Phoebe Ellsworth and Klaus Scherer and Lisa Feldman Barrett and Nico Frijda and Paul Ekman and Joe LeDoux and Derek Matravers and Alexandra Main and Jodi Halpern and George Marcus and Jason Brennan and Kathleen Searles and Travis Ridout and Samuel Justin Sinclair', 'eprint': 'http://emotionresearcher.com/reintroducing-emotional-intelligence-what-it-is-and-where-we-stand-now/', 'title': 'Reintroducing Emotional Intelligence: What it Is and Where We Stand Now', 'url': 'http://emotionresearcher.com/reintroducing-emotional-intelligence-what-it-is-and-where-we-stand-now/'}, 'id_citations': '8ss8qzcAAAAJ:N5tVd3kTz84C', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">In this study, we investigated the effect of leader-member exchange (LMX) on team-member exchange (TMX), and tested the meditation effects of social identification and positive affect in the relationships between LMX and TMX. Our sample comprised of 291 front-line employees working within local branches of an Australian banking organisation. Results showed that LMX was positively related to social identification, positive affect, and TMX. We found further that social identification and positive affect mediated relationships between LMX and TMX. Our findings suggest that employees enjoying high-quality LMX relationships tend to develop high-quality TMX relationships; and that this is because they socially identify with their work groups, and experience positive emotions in the relationships that strengthen their relationships with other team members.(120 words)</div></div></div>', 'author': 'HM Herman and Marie T Dasborough and Neal M Ashkanasy', 'eprint': 'http://www.anzam.org/wp-content/uploads/pdf-manager/2279_TSE_DASBOROUGH_ASH_1.PDF', 'title': 'Implications of Cognitive and Affective Mechanisms for Interpersonal Exchange Relationships in Teams', 'url': 'http://www.anzam.org/wp-content/uploads/pdf-manager/2279_TSE_DASBOROUGH_ASH_1.PDF'}, 'id_citations': '8ss8qzcAAAAJ:M05iB0D1s5AC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">The present study advances the research on interpersonal exchange relationships by integrating social exchange, workplace friendship and climate research to develop a multilevel model. We tested the model with data obtained from a sample of 215 manager-employee dyads working in 36 teams using hierarchical linear modelling (HLM). At the individual level, LMX was positively associated with workplace friendship. Further, workplace friendship was positively related to TMX, and mediated the LMX-TMX relationship. At the team level, HLM results indicate that the relationship between LMX and workplace friendship was moderated by affective climate. Findings suggest that high-quality LMX relationships are associated with enhanced workplace friendship between employees, especially when affective group climate is strong and positive.(114 words)</div></div></div>', 'author': 'HM Herman and Marie T Dasborough and Neal M Ashkanasy', 'eprint': 'http://www.anzam.org/wp-content/uploads/pdf-manager/2278_TSE_CROSS_LEVEL32_ANZAM__PAPER%5B1%5D%5B1%5D.PDF', 'title': 'Cross-Level Effects of Affective Climate on Leader-Member Exchange, Workplace Friendship and Team-Member Exchange', 'url': 'http://www.anzam.org/wp-content/uploads/pdf-manager/2278_TSE_CROSS_LEVEL32_ANZAM__PAPER%5B1%5D%5B1%5D.PDF'}, 'id_citations': '8ss8qzcAAAAJ:RGFaLdJalmkC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Leadership researchers have recently begun to focus on issues of authenticity, ethicality, and intentionality. While these issues have been explored with respect to individual leaders, there has been no examination of authenticity within teams, however. Within the team context, team member perceptions of “fairness of LMX differentiation” may contribute to their perceptions of authentic leadership. We explore fairness of LMX differentiation as a determinant of team-member exchange (TMX) quality. In our proposed model, perceived fairness of LMX differentiation influences team members’ perceptions of leader authenticity; this then influences team member affect (positive and negative); then ultimately, impacts the quality of the TMX relationship. We conclude with a discussion of implications of our model for theory, research and practice.(118 words)</div></div></div>', 'author': 'HM Herman and Marie T Dasborough and Neal M Ashkanasy', 'eprint': 'http://www.anzam.org/wp-content/uploads/pdf-manager/2538_TSE_HERMAN_LE-17.PDF', 'title': 'Authentic Leadership and Team Member Perceptions of LMX Differentiation Fairness', 'url': 'http://www.anzam.org/wp-content/uploads/pdf-manager/2538_TSE_HERMAN_LE-17.PDF'}, 'id_citations': '8ss8qzcAAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC', 'source': 'citations'}]
