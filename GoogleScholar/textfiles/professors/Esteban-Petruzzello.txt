Given that the announcement of these restrictions effectively increases the future cost of smoking, we should expect forward-looking smokers to curb their consumption before the restriction is effective due to complementarity between present and future consumption. I perform the estimation using detailed, high-frequency household-level purchase data. The results provide evidence against the forward-looking behaviour of smokers. Households do not reduce their cigarette purchases before announced public smoking restrictions are established; they only do so once the restriction is in effect.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Esteban Petruzzello', 'eprint': 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00036846.2018.1540845', 'journal': 'Applied Economics', 'number': '19', 'pages': '2061-2069', 'publisher': 'Routledge', 'title': 'Testing for forward-looking behaviour: evidence from the enactment of smoking restrictions', 'url': 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00036846.2018.1540845', 'volume': '51', 'year': 2019}, 'citedby': 2, 'id_citations': 'yTMUHMwAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C', 'id_scholarcitedby': '15854213825093000825', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">I use detailed household-level data to investigate the potential impact of a ban on menthol cigarettes on smoking when compared to intervention policies such as taxes and public smoking restrictions. The results show that menthols are less addictive than non-menthols and that demand for menthol cigarettes is less price sensitive. Public smoking restrictions are unsuccessful in reducing menthol smoking, though they do reduce non-menthol consumption. Additionally, higher prices do not increase the likelihood of quitting for menthol smokers. These findings indicate that current policies are ineffective in curbing menthol smoking and strengthen the case for a complete ban.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Esteban Petruzzello', 'eprint': 'https://www.bus.miami.edu/_assets/pdfs/faculty-papers/economics/epetruzzello/Measuring%20the%20Effect%20of%20Policy%20on%20the%20Demand%20for%20Menthol%20Cigarettes.pdf', 'journal': 'Eastern Economic Journal', 'number': '3', 'pages': '422-445', 'publisher': 'Palgrave Macmillan UK', 'title': 'Measuring the Effect of Policy on the Demand for Menthol Cigarettes: Evidence from Householdâ€‘Level Purchase Data', 'url': 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41302-019-00139-2', 'volume': '45', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 2, 'id_citations': 'yTMUHMwAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '15380685653730849459', 'source': 'citations'}]
