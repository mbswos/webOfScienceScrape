The equilibrium is constrained efficient, assigning more bidders to auctioneers with larger gains from trade. The choice of the trading mechanism is crucial for the result. Most notably, the use of second‐price auctions (equivalently, ex post bidding) leads to the nonexistence of any informative equilibrium.

The spirit of such exercises is to ensure that other results we might obtain regarding Walrasian economies are not, in general, particular to the parameters of the economy we have chosen. However, the majority of results in the literature are not for an economy (ie, given an endowment and preferences) but rather for a set of economies (ie, a set of endowments given preferences). Therefore, for results obtained over a set of endowments, the more appropriate robustness result would not be to look at how prices and allocations respond to perturbations of individual economies, but rather to perturb economies uniformly over the space of endowments for which the result is obtained. In this chapter, we examine the robustness of the uniqueness of Walrasian endowment economies with Cobb–Douglas utility functions, under the latter’s interpretation of robustness.
