We develop and estimate a model in which individuals face uninsured human capital risks and invest in education, acquire work experience, accumulate assets, and smooth consumption. Agents can borrow from the private lending market and from government student loan programs. The private market credit limit is explicitly derived by extending the natural borrowing limit of Aiyagari (1994) to incorporate endogenous labor supply, human capital accumulation, psychic costs of working, and age. We quantify the effects of cognitive ability, noncognitive ability, parental education, and parental wealth on educational attainment, wages, and consumption. We conduct counterfactual experiments with respect to tuition subsidies and enhanced student loan limits and evaluate their effects on …</div></div></div></div></div>', 'author': 'Rong Hai and James J Heckman', 'eprint': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1094202517300029', 'journal': 'Review of economic dynamics', 'pages': '4-36', 'publisher': 'Academic Press', 'title': 'Inequality in human capital and endogenous credit constraints', 'url': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1094202517300029', 'volume': '25', 'year': 2017}, 'citedby': 28, 'id_citations': 'zjzEIHUAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '8176355315619925551', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">We investigate how the reduction of income inequality through tax policy affects economic growth. Taxation at different points of the income distribution has heterogeneous impacts on households’ incentives to work, invest, and consume. Using US state‐level data and micro‐level household tax returns over the last three decades, we find that reducing income inequality between low and median income households improves economic growth. However, reducing income inequality through taxation between median and high‐income households reduces economic growth. These asymmetric economic growth effects are attributable both to supply‐side factors (i.e. changes in small business activity and labour supply) and to consumption demand.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Siddhartha Biswas and Indraneel Chakraborty and Rong Hai', 'eprint': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ecoj.12485', 'journal': 'The Economic Journal', 'number': '601', 'pages': '688-727', 'title': 'Income inequality, tax policy, and economic growth', 'url': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ecoj.12485', 'volume': '127', 'year': 2017}, 'citedby': 23, 'id_citations': 'zjzEIHUAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '15378611565316083533', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">This paper develops and structurally estimates a life-cycle model where health, education, and wealth are endogenous accumulated processes depending on the history of an individual\'s optimal behaviors, on parental factors, and on cognitive and noncognitive abilities. The model investigates different pathways between education, health, and wealth by introducing endogenous human capital production, health production, and addictive preferences of unhealthy behavior in the presence of credit constraints. The effects of education on health include both the direct benefits of improving health production efficiency and the indirect benefits of reducing unhealthy behavior and raising earnings. Using data from National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 97, we estimate the model using a two-step estimation procedure based on factor analysis and simulated method of moments. Using estimated model, we quantify the relative importance of socioeconomic determinants of human capital inequality and health inequality. We also use to model to conduct counterfactual policy experiments.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Rong Hai and James J Heckman', 'eprint': 'https://hceconomics.uchicago.edu/sites/default/files/file_uploads/Dynamic%20Model%20-%20JJH.%20Hai._HH_12012015.pdf', 'title': 'A dynamic model of health, education, and wealth with credit constraints and rational addiction', 'url': 'https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2688384', 'year': 2015}, 'citedby': 12, 'id_citations': 'zjzEIHUAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '17957789035374802270', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">We propose a new classification of consumption goods into nondurable goods, durable goods and a new class which we call" memorable" goods. A good is memorable if a consumer can draw current utility from its past consumption experience through memory. We propose a novel consumption-savings model in which a consumer has a well-defined preference ordering over both nondurable goods and memorable goods. Memorable goods consumption differs from nondurable goods consumption in that current memorable goods consumption may also impact future utility through the accumulation process of the stock of memory. In our model, households optimally choose a lumpy profile of memorable goods consumption even in a frictionless world. Using Consumer Expenditure Survey data, we then document levels and volatilities of different groups of consumption goods expenditures, as well as their expenditure patterns, and show that the expenditure patterns on memorable goods indeed differ significantly from those on nondurable and durable goods. Finally, we empirically evaluate our model\'s predictions with respect to the welfare cost of consumption fluctuations and conduct an excess-sensitivity test of the consumption response to predictable income changes. We find that (i) the welfare cost of household-level consumption fluctuations may be overstated by 1.7 percentage points (11.9% points as opposed to 13.6% points of permanent consumption) if memorable goods are not appropriately accounted for;(ii) the finding of excess sensitivity of consumption documented in important papers of the literature might be entirely due to the …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Rong Hai and Dirk Krueger and Andrew Postlewaite', 'eprint': 'https://www.nber.org/papers/w19386.pdf', 'number': 'w19386', 'publisher': 'National Bureau of Economic Research', 'title': 'On the welfare cost of consumption fluctuations in the presence of memorable goods', 'url': 'https://www.nber.org/papers/w19386', 'year': 2013}, 'citedby': 10, 'id_citations': 'zjzEIHUAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '955882836719668560', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Over the last 30 years in the US, less educated workers have experienced a sharp decline in health insurance coverage rate and stagnant wage growth. In contrast, more educated workers\' health insurance coverage rate has stayed relatively stable and their wages have rapidly grown. This paper investigates the determinants of the increase in inequality in health insurance coverage and wages by estimating an overlapping generations equilibrium model of labor and health insurance markets\' demand and supply. The estimated model is used to quantify the effects of changes in aggregate factors (including rising cost of medical care services, Medicaid eligibility expansion, skill-biased technological changes in the labor market, and changes in the labor force composition) on the inequality of health insurance coverage and wages. I find that the interaction between the rising cost of medical services and labor market technological change is the most important determinant of the widening gap of health insurance coverage.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Rong Hai', 'number': '13-071', 'publisher': 'PIER Working Paper', 'title': 'The Determinants of Rising Inequality in Health Insurance and Wages, Second Version', 'url': 'https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2228312', 'year': 2015}, 'citedby': 7, 'id_citations': 'zjzEIHUAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '8771264579822921010', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div><div><div class="gsh_csp">Using data from 15 European Union economies, we quantify the real effects of supply-side frictions due to the financial disintegration of European countries since the 2008 financial crisis. We develop a multi-country general equilibrium model with heterogeneous countries and destination-specific financial frictions. Financial institutions allocate capital endogenously across countries, determining the cost of capital to firms and the wealth of nations. The cost of financial disintegration is reduced access to capital for firms which results in lower output. Financial disintegration leads to a 0.54% fall in output in Europe since the crisis. We also estimate benefits of further financial integration.</div></div></div></div></div>', 'author': 'Indraneel Chakraborty and Rong Hai and Hans A Holter and Serhiy Stepanchuk', 'eprint': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304393216301180', 'journal': 'Journal of Monetary Economics', 'pages': '28-45', 'publisher': 'North-Holland', 'title': 'The real effects of financial (dis) integration: A multi-country equilibrium analysis of Europe', 'url': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304393216301180', 'volume': '85', 'year': 2017}, 'citedby': 5, 'id_citations': 'zjzEIHUAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C', 'id_scholarcitedby': '576357272653197985', 'source': 'citations'}]
