Five studies demonstrate the proposed licensing effect of a prior commitment to a virtuous act on subsequent choice. Consistent with the authors\' theory, the preference for an indulgent option diminishes if the licensing task is attributed to an external motivation.

Hence, these choices represent an important domain of consumer decision-making. Yet much of the pioneering work in behavioral decision theory has largely focused on the cognitive aspects of decisionmaking without exploring its emotional dimensions (Kahneman 1991). This research program was initially juxtaposed against standard economic theory, according to which consumers maximize utility in a rational and cognitively driven manner. Research in behavioral decision-making therefore followed a paradigm of contrasting actual choices to predictions derived from these rational models. Parallel research on consumer information-processing took a similar approach and viewed consumers as rationally bounded yet emotionally dispassionate decision-makers who logically evaluate alternatives in terms of trade-offs among product attributes. This research, with its roots in problem-solving, has emphasized effort-accuracy trade-offs in decision-making and similarly neglected the emotional dimensions of choice (Payne et al. 1988).

The first paper by Yang and Galak proposes sentimental value as a new component of the happiness that consumers drive from products in addition to feature-related utility.

Conventional wisdom and most of past research suggests that emotions, especially negative ones, can adversely affect decision-making and can have both short and long-term consequences. For example, a study by Shiv, Loewenstein and Bechara (2005) showed that people who do not experience negative emotions after losses (due to brain damage) end-up making more money than those who do. The idea being that experiencing of negative emotions can guide bad decisions. Similarly, Tiedens and Linton (2001) showed that negative affect (eg, anger) leads to impulsiveness and shallow-processing of information. Others have similarly documented detrimental effects of negative affect on performance (Zeelenberg and Beattie 1997), product evaluation and brand attitude (De Houwer, Thomas, and Baeyens 2001). Hence a picture that emerges from the above literature consistently portrays that negative emotions generally impair judgment and decision-making.

However, while research has demonstrated the significance of justification-based processes in consumer choice (eg, Simonson 1992; Kivetz and Simonson 2002; Kivetz and Zheng 2006), we still know relatively little about the factors that moderate and inform these general processes. The present session seeks to provide an indepth look at justification-based processes by examining their situational and motivational antecedents as well as the different ways in which they shape choice and satisfaction. How do features of the choice-set, prior beliefs, and emotions both provoke and moderate justification processes? Can the same justification be used in different contexts to arrive at different choice outcomes? How much are good justifications worth to consumers? The session will address these and related questions as it works to deepen our understanding of the role of justification in choice. Khan, Dhar, and Fishbach (paper 1) examine the motivational role of guilt in indulgent choices and justification processes. Unlike past research which has generally assumed that people who feel guilty should abstain from indulging, this research suggests that guilt can sometimes increase rather than decrease indulgence. Three studies demonstrate that priming guilt creates a motivation to feel not-guilty, leading people to interpret their mundane choices as virtuous and use these virtuous choices as justifications to relapse and indulge.</div><div class="gsh_csp">Sela, Berger, and Liu (paper 2 …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Uzma Khan and Ravi Dhar and Ayelet Fishbach', 'eprint': 'http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/v36/NAACR_v36_44.pdf', 'journal': 'ACR North American Advances', 'title': 'Guilt as motivation: The role of guilt in choice justification', 'url': 'http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/14469/volumes/v36/NA-36', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 6, 'id_citations': 'IKgedCoAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C', 'id_scholarcitedby': '13518328889646505839', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Although consumers in the real world often make a number of similar choices, most consumer research has focused on preferences when each choice is made in isolation. Present research examines the effects of viewing a choice as one of a series of similar choices rather than as an isolated choice. I propose that viewing a choice in the context of similar future choices provides people with a guilt-reducing justification to exert less self-control in the present choice by allowing them to optimistically believe that they will be able to exercise more self-control in future choices. Specifically, the paper shows that (1) in a choice between a relative vice (eg, a cookie) and a relative virtue (eg, a plain fat-free yogurt) the choice share of the vice increases when the decision is presented as one of a series of similar future choices than if the same choice is viewed in isolation, and (2) the overall choice share of a vice increases when decisions are seen in connection with similar future choices.

Conventional wisdom and most of past research suggests that emotions, especially negative ones, can adversely affect decision-making and can have both short and long-term consequences. For example, a study by Shiv, Loewenstein and Bechara (2005) showed that people who do not experience negative emotions after losses (due to brain damage) end-up making more money than those who do. The idea being that experiencing of negative emotions can guide bad decisions. Similarly, Tiedens and Linton (2001) showed that negative affect (eg, anger) leads to impulsiveness and shallow-processing of information. Others have similarly documented detrimental effects of negative affect on performance (Zeelenberg and Beattie 1997), product evaluation and brand attitude (De Houwer, Thomas, and Baeyens 2001). Hence a picture that emerges from the above literature consistently portrays that negative emotions generally impair judgment and decision-making. Papers in the present session take another in-depth look at the functioning of commonly experienced negative emotions and uncover how negative affect, despite its reputation, can help improve decision-making and wellbeing in certain contexts. The session includes three papers, which are all in advance stages of completion.

Hedonic consumption, which is experiential in nature refers to “multi-sensory, fantasy and emotive aspects of one’s experience with products”(Hirschman and Holbrook 1982) while utilitarian consumption is instrumental and functional in nature (Dhar and Wertenbroch 2000; Strahilevitz and Myers 1998). A number of choice conflicts have been examined under the broad “hedonicutilitarian” choice umbrella (Khan, Dhar, and Wertenbroch 2005), such as choices between hedonic and utilitarian options (Dhar and Wertenbroch 2000), luxuries and necessities (Kivetz and Simonson 2002a, b), frivolous and practical consumption (Strahilevitz 1999; Strahilevitz and Myers 1998), vices and virtues (Read, Loewenstein, and Kalyanaraman 1999; Wertenbroch 1998)“shoulds” and ‘wants”(Bazerman, Tenbrunsel, and Wade-Benzoni 1998), affective and cognitive preferences (Shiv and Fedorikhin 1999) and “affect-rich” and “affect-poor”(Hsee and Rottenstreich 2004) consumption.

More recent work has begun to explore the implications that CLT has for consumer choice (Dhar &amp; Kim, 2007). While the original CLT research focused on temporal distance (Trope &amp; Liberman, 2000), it soon expanded to encompass manipulations of psychological distance more generally, showing that variations in psychological distance cause consumers to form different representations of the same stimuli (eg, products). CLT posits that when psychological distance is greater consumers will have a more abstract construal of a stimulus, forming a higher-level representation focused on central features. Conversely, reducing psychological distance can lead to more concrete construals, characterized by lower-level representations enriched with details (Trope &amp; Liberman, 2003). While the first generation of research questions focused on extending what was known about how psychological distance influenced judgment or simple choice situations, the next generation extends these now established findings into the emerging areas of consumer choice and explores natural environmental variables that can prompt these different construals. For example, consumers often choose among non-comparable options or choose from products in adjacent categories. In these circumstances, factors such as the date or an event’s probability may exert a natural influence on consumers’ construals.

It helps us develop normative theories about how we should use our time and money and descriptive accounts of how others actually do use theirs. But are researchers and practitioners focusing on the right things? What are we really capturing when we ask people to consider uncertain outcomes? Risk assessment has traditionally been characterized by a mental balancing of probabilities and outcomes, and changing these parameters has been thought to influence our perceptions of a prospect. While this is certainly part of the story, we wonder what else changes simultaneously with risk than can cause shifts in preferences. How much of risk preference is really related to risk itself, and how much is caused by these other changes?

For example, when considering options one at a time, people prefer options with high relative payoffs to themselves versus an opponent, but when considering multiple options at once, people prefer options with high absolute payoffs to themselves, and relative payoffs become less important (Bazerman et al. 1992). This preference reversal between separate versus joint evaluation (considering one option at a time versus considering multiple options at a time) prompts a question about how decisions made about motivation, which are typically made in separate evaluation (Will I do a task for Incentive X?), and decisions made about preference, which are typically made in joint evaluation (Do I prefer Incentive X or Incentive Y?), may differ. The current paper seeks to investigate the motivational consequences of joint versus separate preference patterns, and in the process, contribute insights that inform the design of effective incentive and promotion schemes.

The question is important and deserves attention as rather subtle cues can unconsciously activate different mindsets that can in turn have substantial effects on thought production, information encoding, information retrieval and ultimately behavior (eg, Kray &amp; Galinski 2003; Sassenberg &amp; Moskowitz 2005). Such influence of contextual cues is well documented in other areas of consumer behavior research. For example, task requirements (eg, fluent or difficult-Novemsky et al. forthcoming), consumption settings (eg, public vs. private-Ratner &amp; Kahn 2002) and initial primes (eg, elderly stereotypes-Bargh et al. 1996) have all been shown to impact consumer cognitions and behavior. Moreover, as mindsets have been shown to affect tasks that are not necessarily related to the task that stimulated these mindsets (eg, Smith &amp; Branscombe 1987; Chandran &amp; Morwitz 2005), examining the impact of mindsets on consumer decision making is highly important, given the multiple cues and tasks consumers face.

By establishing these bases for valuation, we reconcile several conundrums including when donation incentives can be more motivating than monetary rewards to the self, and why monetary incentives of the same amount can be differentially motivating. The research thus addresses important practical questions about how to design incentives, and contributes to theories of motivation under incentives.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Kelly Goldsmith and Uzma Khan and Ravi Dhar', 'journal': 'Vanderbilt Owen Graduate School of Management Research Paper', 'number': '3102489', 'pages': '18-7', 'title': 'The Role of Affect in Extrinsic Incentives', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4386418647957153248&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'IKgedCoAAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Previous literature has suggested that consumers who reason about their choices make less satisfying decisions. This effect is a function of consumers making choices based on their reasons rather than based on their preferences (eg Wilson &amp; Schooler, 1991; Wilson et al., 1993). We argue that this view is incomplete. While prior work largely characterizes reasons solely as rational and cognitive arguments, we posit that reasons often also take the form of arguments based in affective factors. By introducing this distinction between “cognition-based reasons”(grounded in rational evaluations) and “affect-based reasons”(grounded in feelings and emotions, not to be confused with the mere experience of affect), we illustrate that reasoning is not detrimental as a rule. Instead, post-choice satisfaction depends on whether the reasons being generated are “compatible” with the product category in question. If consumers generate reasons that align with the preference basis of a product category (ie, cognition-based reasons in utilitarian categories or affect-based reasons in hedonic categories), then consumers will tend to choose products that align well with their preferences. In other words, unlike in previous findings where reasoning leads to the selection of less satisfying options, the use of compatible reasoning will lead consumers to choose the same types of options (and therefore be equally satisfied) as if they had simply chosen on the basis of their preferences. Only when reasoning is “incompatible” with the product category (ie, cognition-based reasons in hedonic categories or affect-based reasons in utilitarian categories) do consumers’ choices …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Alexander DePaoli and Uzma Khan and Itamar Simonson', 'eprint': 'http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/v45/acr_vol45_1023839.pdf', 'journal': 'ACR North American Advances', 'title': 'Reason-Product (In) Compatibility: Cognition and Affect in Consumer Reasoning', 'url': 'http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/v45/acr_vol45_1023839.pdf', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'IKgedCoAAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Consumers deal with uncertainty on a regular basis: They have to navigate uncertainty in their preferences, process uncertain marketing information, make decisions that could have uncertain outcomes, and even make choices under the influence of incidental feelings of uncertainty.

These decisions may be influenced by options that lie outside the decision frame and about which no decision needs to be made. These outside options may be desired but unavailable, they may provide substitutes for options in the focal decision frame, or they may have previously been rejected. The present session explores the roles that such outside options play in forfeiture and replacement decisions. Forfeiture and replacement decisions are an important subset of the choices consumers commonly make. Consumers must decide whether to forgo attending a desired concert in bad weather or give up a working phone to obtain an upgraded replacement. Previous research finds that how consumers process information about products is affected by whether that decision is an acquisition decision or a forfeiture or replacement decision (Dhar and Wertenbroch 2000). Such decisions are often driven by factors such as the chooser’s commitment to a focal option and the ease in which the chooser can replace that option (Fitzsimons 2000). Accordingly, whether people consider outside options, the type of outside options people consider, and the similarity of outside options to focal options are likely to affect forfeiture and replacement decisions. Four papers look at different factors that prompt consumers to consider outside options and explore implications for forfeiture and replacement decisions. Weiss and Kivetz show that availability of an attractive outside option that was part of an incidental (rather than inherent) choice can make people …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Uzma Khan', 'eprint': 'http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/v42/acr_v42_17711.pdf', 'journal': 'ACR North American Advances', 'title': 'How Outside Options Influence Choice of Substitutes', 'url': 'http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/v42/acr_v42_17711.pdf', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'IKgedCoAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">While ego-depletion (whereby requiring consumers to selfregulate subsequently lowers their self-control) is well established in prior literature, relatively little is known about how self-control resource can be replenished (Baumeister, Schmeichel &amp; Vohs 2007). Current article fills this void by examining when exerting self-control may augment, rather than deplete, the self-regulation resources. The focus is different from recent research that has started to examine the moderating factors of depletion, such as the level of autonomy (Nix et al., 1999), self-affirmation (Schmeichel &amp; Vohs, 2009), choice domain (Dewitte et al., 2009), and rest or glucose (Gaillot &amp; Baumeister, 2007). The focus of the current research is on how exerting self-control itself increase self-regulatory resources. It is proposed that a self-regulation task that gets easier over time (improving experience) can replenish self-control resources and increase self-control in subsequent tasks. The replenishing effect occurs because when people perceive themselves as getting better on an effortful self-regulation task it increases their perceived self-efficacy (Bandura, 1982). Self-efficacy is at the core of human motivation and increasing it can counter the depleting effects of initial self-regulation, consequently increasing self-control in subsequent behavior. Multiple studies support the proposed framework. Study 1 used a choice between a cookie and a plain yogurt as a measure of self-control (Khan &amp; Dhar, 2007) and anagrams as a potentially depleting task before the choice.

Despite the pervasive impact of mindsets, consumer researchers have only recently started to investigate their antecedents and consequences for consumers, integrate new findings with existing ones, and explore how mindsets affect the interaction among different actors in the marketplace. How might purchasing different types of products activate different mindsets that impact subsequent decisions? Can activated mindsets change managers’ decisions and consumers’ interactions with others? And what is the role of mindsets in people’s perceptions of bargains? The current session addresses these and related questions, and offers cutting-edge insights into the causes and role of mindsets in judgment and decision making. The first paper, by Khan et al., makes an important contribution by identifying a novel mindset that consumers develop while making purchases. It compares the cognitive consequences of making hedonic versus utilitarian purchases and shows that purchasing hedonic products induces a justification mindset, which increases choice of easy-to-justify options in a subsequent situation. The second paper, by Moorman et al., demonstrates that activating a comparative mindset not only increases managers’ likelihood of making hypothetical purchases but also elevates their spending levels in real business decisions.

The decision becomes difficult when these goals conflict with each other (Fishbach and Ferguson 2007; Kruglanski et al. 2002). For instance, a consumer may want to loose weight and enjoy tasty foods, or save money and travel the world, or may wish to get a promotion at work and spend time with family. Reconciling the pursuit of conflicting goals is psychologically aversive and induces decisiondifficulty. Prior literature has noted that goal conflict decreases motivation and the likelihood that individuals will strive to achieve the conflicting goals (McKeeman and Karoly 1991). Contrary to past research, we propose that goal conflict can have positive impact on motivation. Our proposition is based on the finding that subjective experiences of difficulty can serve as an input into judgment (Schwarz 2004). Though subjective difficulty often decreases subsequent evaluations (Novemsky et al. 2007), recent research suggests that it may also have positive effects, such as making products seem more unique and instrumental to goal attainment (Pocheptsova et al. 2010; Labroo and Kim 2009), and increasing the perceived importance of decisions (Sela and Berger 2011). Building on this literature, we propose that subjective experience of difficulty associated with negotiating conflict among one’s goals will influence evaluation of those goals. Specifically, we posit that people would expect to experience more conflict when goals are more (versus less) important.

However, previous research on the beneficial effects of positive mood primarily focuses on the pursuit of a single focal goal. Yet, consumers frequently pursue multiple goals simultaneously: An individual may wish to enjoy nice restaurants, lose ten pounds, spend time with family and exercise regularly. Multiple goal-pursuit often creates a self-control dilemma when pursuing one goal is seen to be in conflict with pursuing another goal (Fishbach and Dhar 2005).

Illuminating these deep determinants of value shaping the endowment effect and related phenomena can inform novel predictions, identify the potential scope of observed effects, and reveal the degree to which various market incentives will mitigate or enhance effects (Chen, Lakshminarayanan and Santos 2006).

The collection of papers brought together for this session captures that feeling. Consider the following questions: Is a business traveler, who is choosing between a tasty but unhealthy breakfast and a healthy but less tasty plain fatfree yogurt, more likely to choose the tasty less healthy breakfast if she views this decision as one of a series that she expects to make over the next three days? Do consumers’ expectations of their own ability to use a new product affect their evaluations of such products? And, does consuming a drink expected to improve physical performance but purchased on sale (vs. at regular price) results in poorer perceived performance in fitness-related activities? While each of these questions (studied in the three papers) investigates a different substantive domain, the theoretical thread that sews them together is the impact of expectations. Consumers’ choices, evaluations, and behaviors are often materially influenced by their expectations of what should be, both now and in the future. For example, when people buy multiple items simultaneously for consumption over several periods they choose more variety than if they buy one item before each consumption, presumably because they expect satiation in their tastes. Expectations are ubiquitous in consumer research, but often in a supporting, rather than leading, role. In this session we bring expectations to the forefront.

Given limitations on resources, people regularly face difficult decisions to either indulge in a vice or to exercise self-control and be virtuous. This conflict can be viewed from several different perspectives. In the traditional literature the difficulty of such tradeoffs is not directly addressed. Rather, consumer decisions are assumed to be based on stable evaluations of utility (eg Von Neumann and Morgenstern 1947) and conscious choices guide moment-to-moment behaviors (eg Deci and Ryan 1985, Mischel, Cantor and Feldman 1996). Vices and virtues are evaluated on a common utility scale and higher utility options are consciously chosen and acted upon.</div><div class="gsh_csp">One alternative stream of literature explores myopic, shortsighted behavior, in which the utility of long-term benefits is overly discounted relative to short-term desires (eg Ainsle 1975; Loewenstein 1996; Hoch and Loewenstein 1991). The myopic focus on short-term benefits can lead to over-consumption of hedonic vices and insufficient allocation of resources to longerterm virtues.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Uzma Khan and Oleg Urminsky', 'eprint': 'http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/v31/acr_vol31_117.pdf', 'journal': 'ACR North American Advances', 'title': 'Special Session Summary Navigating Between Virtues and Vices: Moderators of Decisions Involving Hedonic Versus Utilitarian Choices', 'url': 'http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/v31/acr_vol31_117.pdf', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'IKgedCoAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Consumers are faced with choices each day. Marketers try desperately to influence our decision-making process, capturing our attention and appealing to our instincts with pithy ads like Apple\'s" Think Different" or Burger King\'s" Have it Your Way." These types of advertisements often work well, helping consumers draw comparisons and make selections between similar products in a noisy marketplace.</div><div class="gsh_csp">Of course, some choices are more difficult to navigate than others. As the number of available alternatives increase so does decision difficulty (eg, Iyengar and Lepper 2000). Similarly, most consumers (and researchers) would agree that" apples-to-apples" comparisons are generally easier to navigate than" apples-to-oranges" comparisons (Bettman and Sujan 1987; Johnson 1984; Zhang and Markman 2001). Choosing between two competing brands of cars, for example, is assumed to be an easier choice to make than choosing between a new car and a trip to Europe.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Eunice Kim Cho and Uzma Khan and Ravi Dhar', 'eprint': 'https://www.baylor.edu/business/kellercenter/news.php?action=story&story=131751', 'title': 'Keller Center for Research', 'url': 'https://www.baylor.edu/business/kellercenter/news.php?action=story&story=131751'}, 'id_citations': 'IKgedCoAAAAJ:NMxIlDl6LWMC', 'source': 'citations'}]
