This book helps bridge this gap between applied economists and theoretical nonparametric econometricians.

The analysis starts with density estimation and motivates the procedures through methods that should be familiar to the reader. It then moves on to kernel regression, estimation with discrete data, and advanced methods such as estimation with panel data and instrumental variables models. The book pays close attention to the issues that arise with programming, computing speed, and application.

Many different methods have been proposed (Navrud and Ready 2007). They all use estimates from one or more previous studies to predict the benefits from a new policy at a different point in space, time, or both. Under what conditions will these predictions be valid? Previous work on benefit transfer methodology has addressed this question by suggesting informal guidelines for the selection of previous studies (Water Resources Research 28 (3), 1992 and Ecological Economics 60 (2), 2006).

The so-called ‘Hausman test’ has been applied and extended theoretically in a variety of econometric domains. This paper discusses the basic Hausman test and its development within econometric panel data settings since its publication. We focus on the construction of the Hausman test in a variety of panel data settings, and in particular, the recent adaptation of the Hausman test to semiparametric and nonparametric panel data models.

We use a semiparametric model with a rich panel of manufacturing firms in Romania from 1995 to 2003 to estimate firm-level markups. We find that markups are higher in more concentrated industries and less exposed to foreign competition. Trade integration appears to generally increase competitive pressure on markups. Industries exposed to more international competition experience a larger change in markups following integration into the European Union’s Common Market. However, as the initial impact of tariff reduction fades away, higher markups become an important element in firms’ pricing strategies.

Our nonparametric specification enables us to model technology allowing for heterogeneity across all relevant dimensions (i.e. countries, sectors and time). Using data spanning from the 1960s to the 2000s, covering 42 OECD and non OECD countries across 11 manufacturing sectors, we find TEP and TFP to account for roughly 46 and −6% of labor productivity growth respectively, on average.

We use semi-parametric methods to estimate a hybrid quadratic cost function for a unique data set that contains specialists and conglomerate banking and insurance firms. The advantage of the semi-parametric model is that it provides firm-level estimates for the coefficients of the objective function. These estimates in turn are functions of a set of variables that may help explain scope economies. In contrast to previous findings, our results provide evidence for the existence of cost economies of scope between US banking and insurance industry. Most conglomerates benefit from synergies between marketing health and life insurance and information provided by loans and deposits as well as reductions in fixed costs and labor costs. Thrift assurbanks benefit the most from the synergies between loans and commercial property and liability insurance as well as reduction in employee cost savings. Notable synergies between deposits and property and liability insurance (mostly personal insurance products) are present only for thrift assurbanks. Reduction in fixed costs and employee costs are weaker correlated to scope economies between deposits and the two insurance categories. Our results show no significant cost synergies in offering the two categories of insurance products jointly.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Gabriel Asaftei and Christopher F Parmeter and Yuan Yuan', 'eprint': 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.596.4753&rep=rep1&type=pdf', 'journal': 'Work-ing paper, Virginia Tech', 'title': 'Economies of scope in financial services: A semi-parametric approach', 'url': 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.596.4753&rep=rep1&type=pdf', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 9, 'id_citations': 'il7-5R8AAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C', 'id_scholarcitedby': '10177519675875437501', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Although the theoretical trade-off between the quantity and quality of children is well established, empirical evidence supporting such a causal relationship is limited.

Specifically, discrete versions (both unordered and ordered) of the popular Epanechnikov kernel do not have rapidly decaying weights.

However, the effect on trade is not nearly as large as that between two RTA members that belong to the GATT/WTO. Contrary to the findings in Rose (2004), this result tends to support the fact that the GATT/WTO has liberalized multilateral trade, outside of RTAs. In other words, the effect of an RTA on countries’ trade who are not party to the GATT/WTO should generate a large RTA trade response due to relatively large pre-existing trade distortions. Second, we show that the GATT/WTO has not promoted successful RTAs using explicit RTA variables that controls for the notification status (to the GATT/WTO) of an RTA.

We find pledged patents to protect environmentally friendly technologies and to be of similar value as the average patent in a pledging firm\'s patent portfolio but of lower value than other patents in their class. Our analysis of the impact of the patent commons on diffusion of patented technologies suggests that making patents accessible royalty-free did not result in any significant increase in diffusion as measured by citing patents.

A large stream of studies considers possible solutions to the endogeneity problem that require as little external information for instrumental variables as possible. This paper pursues the distance function approach to address the endogeneity problem. We first establish probabilistic duality results for deterministic input and output distance functions evaluated at input-output vectors that contain inefficiency and noise. We then resort to the directional distance function (DDF) as a functional representation of technology, and show that it is possible to use the direction vector of the DDF as an internal instrument to cancel out the effects of inefficiency and noise from the observed input-output data. Our main result is to establish orthogonality conditions for econometric identification of the DDF in the case where the direction vector governing the data generating process is known to the econometrician. We also examine possible endogeneity caused by the use of imperfect proxy direction vectors. Building on these insights, an axiomatic, fully nonparametric step-wise approach to estimate the DDF representation of technology is outlined.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Timo Kuosmanen and Andrew L Johnson and Christopher Parmeter', 'journal': 'Available at SSRN 2602340', 'title': 'Orthogonality conditions for identification of joint production technologies: axiomatic nonparametric approach to the estimation of stochastic distance functions', 'url': 'https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2602340', 'year': 2015}, 'citedby': 2, 'id_citations': 'il7-5R8AAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '571485718221456049', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Recent research documents a hump in the trade diversification-income relationship.

Further, several of these newer methods have focused on ensuring that axioms of production hold.

Using a Monte Carlo simulation experiment, this paper compares the performance of six alternative methods commonly applied by regulators. Our results demonstrate that combination approaches, such as taking the maximum or the mean over DEA and SFA efficiency scores, have certain practical merits and might offer a useful alternative to strict reliance on a singular method. In particular, the results highlight that taking the maximum not only minimizes the risk of underestimation, but can also improve the precision of efficiency estimation. Based on our results, we give recommendations for the estimation of individual efficiencies for regulation purposes and beyond.</div></div></div></div></div>', 'author': 'Mark A Andor and Christopher Parmeter and Stephan Sommer', 'eprint': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221718308580', 'journal': 'European Journal of Operational Research', 'number': '1', 'pages': '240-252', 'publisher': 'North-Holland', 'title': 'Combining uncertainty with uncertainty to get certainty?

For policymakers and regulators, how firms respond to regulatory oversight and benchmarking warrants use of panel data almost by definition, and the increase in observations provided by panel data has the potential to improve estimation efficiency and add power to any inference that is conducted.

Using panel data for 175 countries from 1960 to 2010, we find that there is a close link between urbanization and the size of the public sector, especially when looking at education, health care, and social issues. Various robustness checks confirm this finding. An analysis of state‐level public spending in Colombia and Germany confirms our hypothesis on the subnational level. On the microeconomic level, people in urban areas acknowledge that governments should take more responsibility, and they are more in favor of redistribution. This finding can help to explain the evolution of government size, and it can also predict the present and future needs of urbanizing areas.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Michael Jetter and Christopher F Parmeter', 'eprint': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/sjoe.12256', 'journal': 'The Scandinavian Journal of Economics', 'number': '4', 'pages': '1202-1228', 'title': 'Does Urbanization Mean Bigger Governments?', 'url': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/sjoe.12256', 'volume': '120', 'year': 2018}, 'id_citations': 'il7-5R8AAAAJ:hkOj_22Ku90C', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">This note corrects an error–pointed out in Kiviet (2016)–in the Ashley and Parmeter (2015a) derivation of the asymptotic distribution of the OLS parameter estimator in the usual kvariate multiple regression model, but where some or all of the explanatory variables are endogenous.

The trace of the hat matrix is a standard metric for calculating degrees of freedom. Nonparametric-based hat matrices do not enjoy all properties of their parametric counterpart in part owing to the fact that the former do not always stem directly from a traditional ANOVA decomposition. In the multivariate, local polynomial setup with a mix of continuous and discrete covariates, which include some irrelevant covariates, we formulate asymptotic expressions for the trace of the resultant non-ANOVA and ANOVA-based hat matrix from the estimator of the unknown conditional mean. The asymptotic expression of the trace of the non-ANOVA hat matrix associated with the conditional mean estimator is equal up to a linear combination of kernel-dependent constants to that of the ANOVA-based hat matrix. Additionally, we document that the trace of the ANOVA-based hat matrix converges to 0 in any setting where the bandwidths diverge. This attrition outcome can occur in the presence of irrelevant continuous covariates or it can arise when the underlying data generating process is in fact of polynomial order. Simulated examples demonstrate that our theoretical contributions are valid in finite-sample settings.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Nadine McCloud and Christopher F Parmeter', 'eprint': 'https://www.bus.miami.edu/_assets/files/repec/WP2017-14.pdf', 'number': '2017-14', 'title': 'Calculating Degrees of Freedom in Multivariate Local Polynomial Regression', 'url': 'https://www.bus.miami.edu/_assets/files/repec/WP2017-14.pdf', 'year': 2017}, 'id_citations': 'il7-5R8AAAAJ:PELIpwtuRlgC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">1.

In the special case where the parametric component is linear in parameters, our single-step method is asymptotically equivalent to the two-step partially linear model estimator in Robinson (1988). Monte Carlo simulations support the asymptotic developments and show impressive finite sample performance. We apply our method to the case of a partially constant elasticity of substitution production function for an unbalanced sample of 134 countries from 1955-2011 and find that the parametric parameters are relatively stable for different nonparametric control variables in the full sample. However, we find substantial parameter heterogeneity between developed and developing countries which results in important differences when estimating the elasticity of substitution.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'DANIEL J HENDERSON and CHRISTOPHER F PARMETER', 'eprint': 'https://economics.ku.edu/sites/economics.ku.edu/files/files/Seminar/papers1617/March3.pdf', 'title': 'A PARTIALLY PARAMETRIC MODEL', 'url': 'https://economics.ku.edu/sites/economics.ku.edu/files/files/Seminar/papers1617/March3.pdf', 'year': 2015}, 'id_citations': 'il7-5R8AAAAJ:u9iWguZQMMsC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'author': 'Subal C Kumbhakar and Christopher F Parmeter', 'number': '1', 'pages': '1-8', 'publisher': 'PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO', 'title': 'Applied Semi and Nonparametric Econometric Methods Introduction', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3111614167631936878&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'volume': '48', 'year': 2015}, 'id_citations': 'il7-5R8AAAAJ:LjlpjdlvIbIC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">1.1. What is R?. R is an implementation of the object-oriented mathematical programming language S. The S programming environment (S stands for statistics) was developed by AT&amp;T as the single letter competitor to C (also developed by AT&amp;T). R is developed by statisticians around the world and is free software, covered by the GNU General Public License. Syntactically and functionally it is very similar (if not identical) to S+, the popular statistics package. R is capable of running high powered statistical simulations, producing elegant graphics and computing econometric estimates for a wide array of popular estimators. R also has the ability to seamlessly integrate with LATEXto construct fully reproducible scientific research.</div><div class="gsh_csp">1.2. How Can I get R?. R is open source software enabling anyone with an internet connection to instantly download it to your computer and begin working. The easiest place to find R is through its host website The R Project, see Figure 1. Once you have navigated to The R Project webpage seek out the CRAN link on the left hand side. The CRAN tab will then ask you to select a mirror which hosts R, see Figure 2. For this introduction I have elected to use the CRAN link through the University of California, Berkeley. R is supported on Linux, Mac OS/X and Windows operating systems. Depending upon your operating system you will need to select the appropriate link to begin the process of installing R on your computer see Figure 3.

A range of popular hypotheses can be cast in this framework including individual and joint tests of significance, omitted variable tests, tests of constancy of regression response, homogeneity restrictions and so forth. Each of these hypotheses can be expressed in terms of restrictions on the first-order partial derivatives of an unknown conditional mean. While a wide variety of parametric tests exist, they are often criticized due to their reliance on models which, if misspecified, may produce tests that are invalid. A nonparametric test that is robust to functional misspecification would clearly be appealing, however, a few obstacles must be overcome in order to implement a fully nonparametric test. These obstacles include the lack of a generally accepted approach to restricted nonparametric estimation, the prevalence of categorical and continuous data in applied settings, and the fact that asymptotic distributional results are often unsatisfactory in nonparametric settings. In this paper we propose a nonparametric Wald-type statistic which admits mixed data types and a bootstrap approach that yields a test having valid size and impressive power. An advantage of the Wald-type approach is that we only need to estimate the unrestricted model, which is extremely powerful in this framework. We handle the existence of mixed data types by adopting the estimators developed in Racine &amp; Li (2004) and Li &amp; Racine (2004), and a novel method for bootstrapping the null distribution is outlined.

However, the observed input demands are endogenous if rational managers adjust their input use for inefficiency. A large stream of studies considers possible solutions to the endogeneity problem that require as little external information for instrumental variables as possible. This paper pursues the distance function approach to address the endogeneity problem. We first establish probabilistic duality results for deterministic input and output distance functions evaluated at input-output vectors that contain inefficiency and noise. We then resort to the directional distance function (DDF) as a functional representation of technology, and show that it is possible to use the direction vector of the DDF as an internal instrument to cancel out the effects of inefficiency and noise from the observed inputoutput data. Our main result is to establish orthogonality conditions for econometric identification of the DDF in the case where the direction vector governing the data generating process is known to the econometrician. We also examine possible endogeneity caused by the use of imperfect proxy direction vectors. Building on these insights, an axiomatic, fully nonparametric step-wise approach to estimate the DDF representation of technology is outlined.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Timo Kuosmanen and Andrew Johnson and Christopher Parmeter', 'eprint': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andrew_Johnson48/publication/294870285_Orthogonality_Conditions_for_Identification_of_Joint_Production_Technologies_Axiomatic_Nonparametric_Approach_to_the_Estimation_of_Stochastic_Distance_Functions/links/59ffe6cba6fdcca1f29ef289/Orthogonality-Conditions-for-Identification-of-Joint-Production-Technologies-Axiomatic-Nonparametric-Approach-to-the-Estimation-of-Stochastic-Distance-Functions.pdf', 'title': 'Orthogonality conditions for identification of joint production technologies', 'url': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andrew_Johnson48/publication/294870285_Orthogonality_Conditions_for_Identification_of_Joint_Production_Technologies_Axiomatic_Nonparametric_Approach_to_the_Estimation_of_Stochastic_Distance_Functions/links/59ffe6cba6fdcca1f29ef289/Orthogonality-Conditions-for-Identification-of-Joint-Production-Technologies-Axiomatic-Nonparametric-Approach-to-the-Estimation-of-Stochastic-Distance-Functions.pdf'}, 'id_citations': 'il7-5R8AAAAJ:PR6Y55bgFSsC', 'source': 'citations'}]
