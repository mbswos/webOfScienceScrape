The choice of a fixed exchange rate peg implies a specific monetary discipline, namely monetary growth equal to the growth rate of the currency (or currencies) to which a country is pegged. Monetary policy is thus subject to an exchange rate rule rather than to either a monetary growth rule or alternatively to discretionary policy. A fixed exchange rate is a specific case of an active crawling peg where the preannounced rate of change in the exchange rate is zero. Active crawling peg rules whereby the exchange rate is adjusted downward by a preannounced amount over a specified period of time have been practiced in various places, particularly in Latin America.

The model was designed specifically for the Canadian managed float during the period 1952-62. The object of their model is to explain what they term" exchange market pressure"; that is, the pressure on foreign exchange reserves and the exchange rate when there exists an excess of domestic money supply over money demand in a managed floating exchange rate regime. The basic theoretical proposition is that any such excess supply of money can be relieved by an exchange depreciation, a loss in foreign reserves, or, in the context of a managed float, by some combination of the two. In this sense, the GR managed float model used here is firmly rooted in the modern monetary approach to exchange rates and the balance of payments.\'Brazil provides a …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Michael Connolly and Jose Dantas Da Silveira', 'eprint': 'https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1807380.pdf', 'journal': 'The American Economic Review', 'number': '3', 'pages': '448-454', 'publisher': 'American Economic Association', 'title': 'Exchange market pressure in postwar Brazil: An application of the Girton-Roper monetary model', 'url': 'https://www.jstor.org/stable/1807380', 'volume': '69', 'year': 1979}, 'citedby': 152, 'id_citations': 'Bly2nj0AAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '16735570615984462138', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">The monetary approach to the balance of payments suggests that surpluses and deficits are essentially adjustment phenomena which serve to equilibrate the money stock in existence to the quantity demanded in an open economy.

The salaries and rates of return for recent business school graduates suggest that the MBA has not, in fact, outlived its usefulness. An issue casting doubt on the rate of return on the MBA is that the degree represents a signal to potential employers, but may not increase an employee\'s productivity. Some have argued that the increase in earnings derives not only from human capital investment, but also from pure differences in personal ability. The increased earnings of people with MBA degrees could be partly attributed to innate differences in abilities and not to schooling. The expected rate of return for an MBA, while still high, has recently declined. New graduates with MBA degrees are reporting fewer jobs upon graduation than their predecessors.

In particular, the empirical relationship between changes in the exchange rate, real economic activity, and the balance of payments is explored in detail for the decade of the 1960s. There is a misconception shared by many today that generalized floating exchange rates are the rule rather than the exception, and that consequently the discrete nature of exchange rate changes involving large step changes in an adjustable peg is a phenomenon of the past. This is far from being the case since, worldwide, the vast majority of countries have today a fixed peg of one sort or another, principally to the dollar (39 countries), the French franc (14), the pound (1), the Special Drawing Right (15), or to other currency baskets (21) so that 94 of 141 total IMF member countries officially had a fixed currency peg as of December 31, 1980 (Source: IMF Survey, January 26, 1981.)</div><div class="gsh_csp">In some cases, particularly for large countries, exchange rate changes are, however, of a more continuous, reversible nature.

Since Balassa (1964) and Samuelson (1964), most have acknowledged that real exchange rates appreciate in the long run with development due to the higher prices of services. More recently, however, economists in developed economies have focused on short-run fluctuations in real exchange rates arising from mone-tary and fiscal policies, while neglecting long-run factors such as growth and investment. Dornbusch (1989) has identified four approaches in the literature: the monetary approach, the new classical approach, the equilibrium approach, and the macroeco-nomic approach. These models and their shortcomings are dis-cussed in Chapters 1 to 4 and the Appendix of this volume. Development economists, by contrast, have tended to emphasize real factors such as the external terms of trade, commercial policy, and growth as determinants of the real exchange rate. It is no exaggeration to say that the real exchange rate is at the centre of much of development economics. It plays, for example, an important role in theoretical and in empirical work on the current account, export supply, and import demand, as well as in many other areas. It is also a crucial indicator for international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Moreover, the real exchange rate is also important in policy debates and popular discussions in Latin economies.

It assumes that a country must choose to peg to one of two major currencies or to a basket of the two but cannot float independently for optimum currency reasons (Mundell (1961), McKinnon (1963)). In particular, the approach puts the accent on the notion of international competition between national monies (Tullock (1973), Klein (1975)) in a rational-expectations framework with national money demands and supplies causing changes in relative prices (Connolly and Taylor (1979), Dornbusch (1978 …</div></div></div></div></div>', 'author': 'Michael Connolly', 'journal': 'Journal of International Money and Finance', 'pages': '153-164', 'publisher': 'Pergamon', 'title': 'The choice of an optimum currency peg for a small, open country', 'url': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0261560682900110', 'volume': '1', 'year': 1982}, 'citedby': 27, 'id_citations': 'Bly2nj0AAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '5621012640192256727', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"> <div class="gsh_csp">This study examined beliefs of mental health nurses about smoking by clients, nurses, and visitors in inpatient facilities and identified the influence of years of experience, smoke‐free status, and workplace on these beliefs.

The anthology evolved out of a group of papers presented at the Third Dominican Republic Conference on International Debt and Adjustment in 1986. A number of the papers were updated and are presented here along with new ones written especially for this collection. The debt problems of Latin America form the background for the analyses undertaken by the articles in the book. The articles go beyond description of the debt problems to offer insights on the more fundamental long-range problems facing policy makers in the region. Positive analyses into the nature of the adjustment process and insights into future institutional changes that could improve the functioning of the Latin American economies highlight the book. The papers are divided into major topics of concern. The transmission of external shocks to the region and instability to the financial markets are covered. Fiscal constraints, labor market adjustment, exchange rates, and the political economy of adjustment as each relates to the external shocks of the 1980s are investigated. A major essay by Montague Lord shows Latin American potential to reap substantial gains by pursuing policies to encourage expansion of its resource-based comparative-advantage activities. The essays in" Latin American Debt and Adjustment" provide a starting point for the consideration of some of the deeper problems that need to be addressed by any meaningful attempt to improve the market-oriented economies of the region.</div></div>', 'author': 'Philip Lawton Brock and Michael Bahaamonde Connolly and Claudio González Vega', 'publisher': 'Praeger Publishers', 'title': 'Latin American debt and adjustment: external shocks and macroeconomic policies', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=18048347694328173594&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 16, 'id_citations': 'Bly2nj0AAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '18048347694328173594', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Using panel data from 1995 to 2011 for 34 OECD countries, we examine the effects of government consumption spending, public social spending, and public investment on economic growth.

When such zones exist without restrictive exchange controls, they should be preserved and strengthened.

The analysis stresses the transitional nature of liquidity effects resulting from price rises. These effects act so as to create an excess demand for nominal cash balances, which translates itself into both a curtailment of expenditure on goods and a sale of assets abroad. Consequently, the trade balance and the capital account improve as a result of devaluation. The model develops the transitional paths of adjustment toward the new equilibrium. In particular, section 1 begins with the simple case of a small economy with all goods traded, then section 2 incorporates holdings of international assets. In addition to the expenditure dampening effects of devaluation that are now a familiar part of the monetary approach to the balance of payments, a major feature of the model is the suggestion that a temporary improvement in the capital account following devaluation will shift part of the burden away from short-run improvement in the trade account, thereby serving as a cushion in the adjustment process.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Michael Connolly and Dean Taylor', 'journal': 'Recent Issues in International Monetary Economics, North Holland Publishing Company, Amsterdam', 'title': 'Devaluation, Traded Goods and International Assets', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3672930628321802752&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 9, 'id_citations': 'Bly2nj0AAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C', 'id_scholarcitedby': '3672930628321802752', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Palliative care has often challenged the status quo.

Third, and perhaps most important, new techniques can, in many instances, be applied to productive processes throughout the world, independently of their place of origin or discovery. From this standpoint, one can consider new advances as having public or collective characteristics.

In particular, we apply a speculative attack model that links the collapse of the "tablita" with a 5% more rapid monthly rate of growth of domestic credit than exchange rate devaluation. In other words monetary policy was too expansionary relative to the rate of devaluation. With the speculative attack, the money supply, as predicted, fell 21% in the first quarter of 1981 as individuals sold pesos to the Central Bank in exchange for dollars. At the same time, the analysis documents the dramatic real exchange rate appreciation prior to the collapse in March 1981, and the sudden real depreciation that followed.

With a homogeneous population and a well-functioning democratic system, this small country of less than 3 million people was known in the early post-World War II period as the" Switzerland of the South." Four decades later the country had undergone a precipitous decline that put it among the least prosperous middle-income countries. A few comparative figures tell the story. In 1950 Uruguay\'s GDP per capita was $3,784 (in 1985 prices and adjusted to have the same purchasing power as in the United States), close to that in comparable small and wealthy European countries like Belgium ($4,151) or Denmark ($4,512). In the Republic of Korea, a country hailed today as a major development success, GDP per capita in 1953 was $822. In 1960 school enrollment ratios in Uruguay reached 111 percent at the primary level and 37 percent at the secondary level. The corresponding figures for the European countries are 109 percent and 69 percent for Belgium and 103 percent and 65 percent for Denmark; and for Korea, they are 94 percent and 27 percent. 1 Uruguay was definitely among the most developed countries in the world in 1950.

High levels of protection of manufacturing were maintained by taxing agriculture, the main activity in which Uruguay has a strong comparative advantage. What were the causes of the early protectionism, and what have been its consequences? This book provides some answers by analyzing several facets of protectionism in Uruguay\'s recent history. Most of the chapters deal with the welfare costs of the inefficiencies introduced by the various forms of protectionism—tariffs, administered prices, bilateral trading arrangements, and local content requirements. Chapter 8 takes a longer-run perspective on the relationship between the trade regime and growth since the 1950s. This chapter complements the more specific analyses that follow by providing an overview of protection against which to judge the relative importance of the various instruments of protectionism in Uruguay. It also places Uruguay\'s overall performance in a comparative context, and for the reader unfamiliar with Uruguay\'s economic policies, the chapter sketches some of the milestones in the country\'s long history of protectionism. What is striking in this description of protectionism before World War II is that a large number of the protective instruments adopted in the nineteenth century are still around today. The panoply of measures that emerged during the deepening of protection from the 1950s up to the 1974-82 liberalization episode is typical of the measures implemented by countries following a development strategy based on industrialization through import …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Michael B Connolly and Jaime de Melo', 'eprint': 'http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=T8SAu1NunwUC&oi=fnd&pg=PA14&dq=info:rGB1povsWBYJ:scholar.google.com&ots=jrUOESDvA0&sig=Ac8c8zXDBNhOANs1CHZIhW1CmJI', 'journal': 'The Effects of Protectionism on a Small Country: The Case of Uruguay', 'pages': '14', 'publisher': 'World Bank Publications', 'title': 'Protectionism and stagnation: an interpretative history', 'url': 'http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=T8SAu1NunwUC&oi=fnd&pg=PA14&dq=info:rGB1povsWBYJ:scholar.google.com&ots=jrUOESDvA0&sig=Ac8c8zXDBNhOANs1CHZIhW1CmJI', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 1, 'id_citations': 'Bly2nj0AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '1610296951322271916', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">" Suppose four fifths of all the money in Great Britain to be annihilated in one night," David Hume speculated in 1752"... must not the price of all labor and commodities sink in proportion," giving England a competitive advantage in trade which must quickly" bring back the money we had lost, and raise us to the level (of prices) of all the neighboring nations?" 1 This adjustment process was to be christened the Hume specie-flow mechanism, and is, in a fundamental sense, the earliest known statement of a monetary approach to the balance of payments, Hume\'s statement also raised specific issues such as the now-controversial, so-called law of one price.

Our approach here is to consider advanced practice as a generic term which includes clinical nurse specialist and advanced nurse practitioner roles. These are extended roles and signify nurses who practise at a higher level than traditional nurses. The roles are shaped by the countries and context in which the nurse is practising. Our aim is to define the concepts and characteristics in advanced practice in order to provide insights into nursing contributions to palliative care. In this chapter we identify the growing demands for palliative care due to demographic changes alongside the resulting implications for education, professional identify and the scope and development of advanced practice nursing roles. We draw on evidence which demonstrates a \'blurring of professional boundaries\' and \'fluid role boundaries\' in advanced practice roles and which place the person in need of care at the centre of the service model. We also highlight the difficulties in differentiating between specialist, expanded and advanced roles and suggest further work is required to name, value and assess the contributions of such nursing roles.</div></div>', 'author': 'Catriona Kennedy and Michael Connolly', 'eprint': 'https://openair.rgu.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/10059/3345/KENNEDY%202018%20Advanced%20and%20expanded%20roles.pdf?sequence=3', 'publisher': 'Open University Press', 'title': 'Advanced and expanded roles in palliative care nursing.', 'url': 'https://openair.rgu.ac.uk/handle/10059/3345', 'year': 2018}, 'id_citations': 'Bly2nj0AAAAJ:HoB7MX3m0LUC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Ronald McKinnon contributed crucially to our knowledge of the key role of savings, investment and financial intermedication in economic growth. Financial repression by governemt spending on consumption and repressed interest rates leads to low savings which finances investment, thus slowing growth. This is Ron’s message even today. He has castigated the U.S. monetary authorities for falling into a “policy trap” of repressing interest rates, presumably to foster investment and growth. In fact, Ron points out that zero rates deter savings and thus punish both investment and growth.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Michael Connolly', 'journal': 'The Singapore Economic Review', 'number': '02', 'pages': '1640024', 'publisher': 'World Scientific Publishing Company', 'title': 'Ronald Mckinnon’S Contributions To Economics', 'url': 'https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0217590816400245', 'volume': '61', 'year': 2016}, 'id_citations': 'Bly2nj0AAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Background To ensure patients and families receive appropriate end-of-life care pathways and guidelines aim to inform clinical decision making.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Catriona Kennedy and Patricia Brooks-Young and Carol Brunton Gray and Phil Larkin and Michael Connolly and Bodil Wilde-Larsson and Maria Larsson and Tracy Smith and Susie Chater', 'eprint': 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.998.3666&rep=rep1&type=pdf', 'title': 'Diagnosing dying: an integrative', 'url': 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.998.3666&rep=rep1&type=pdf', 'year': 2014}, 'id_citations': 'Bly2nj0AAAAJ:RYcK_YlVTxYC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Schlussfolgerung: MIDOS wurde als wertvolle Ergänzung der vorhandenen Instrumente empfunden.

Education was one of the functions transferred to the Northern Ireland Government as a result of the 1921 Government of Ireland Act. With the introduction of direct rule in 1972, it is part of the responsibility of the Secretary of State. Public expenditure on education is part of the Northern Ireland bloc (Connolly and McAlister, 1988) and, in the final resort, is determined by the Secretary of State. McGill (1987) argued that education as a whole had fallen in priority and lost out in its share of total spending. This chapter will seek to discover whether these trends have been continued in the period since 1986/87. Judgement on whether a specific set of public services has lost out are complex. Defining the concept of cutback is difficult (Hogwood, 1992). Wright (1981), for example, suggests that there are at least six important distinctions that have to be borne in mind when assessing\'cuts\'. It can refer to a reduction in the future rate of growth. It can mean a reduction in either cash or real terms. This helps to focus on the resources going into a programme. This issue is further complicated when we consider changes in demand (however defined), a point not directly commented on by Wright. Reductions in the 4-16 age group might turn an apparent reduction in, say, cash monies to a per pupil increase. Wright also raises the question of the possible mismatch between plans and outcomes. Cuts may result in a planned way as a deliberate result of government</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Michael Connolly', 'journal': 'After the Reforms: Education and Policy in Northern Ireland', 'pages': '33', 'publisher': 'Ashgate Publishing', 'title': '3 The financing', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12421860883610247121&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'Bly2nj0AAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Widely read and cited by researchers and policymakers, the Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking is a primary economics journal reporting major findings in the study of monetary and fiscal policy, credit markets, money and banking, portfolio management, and related subjects.

Breaking down globalized production chains, including those encapsulated by multinational enterprises, on a country-by-country basis is a challenging task which increasingly occupies macroeconomic statistics compilers. This paper builds on the work carried out by the UNECE Task Force on Global Production which is developing a Guide to Measuring Global Production. Among other things, the Guide presents a typology of global production arrangements with the purpose of obtaining a clear understanding of (a) the specific roles of the various entities active in global value chains,(b) the nature of transactions they are engaged in, and (c) ownership issues around assets and IPPs in particular. The Guide aims to assist statisticians in compiling macroeconomic statistics at a national level. Users of the statistics are expected to benefit from this new guidance as well, for example by being provided with highquality information on a country’s changing trade dependencies in an environment of on-going globalization.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Mark de Haan and Michael Connolly and Tihomira Dimova and Rami Peltola', 'eprint': 'http://www.iariw.org/papers/2014/HaanPaper.pdf', 'title': 'Measuring Global Production in the National Accounts and the Balance of Payments', 'url': 'http://www.iariw.org/papers/2014/HaanPaper.pdf'}, 'id_citations': 'Bly2nj0AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C', 'source': 'citations'}]
