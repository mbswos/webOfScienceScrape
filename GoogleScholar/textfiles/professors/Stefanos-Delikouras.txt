We find that the minimum variance stochastic discount factor that satisfies the Euler equation for equity returns cannot satisfy the Euler equation for investment returns, in contradiction of the predictions of the investment model. We consider the implications for this result for recent factor models. Our results suggest that joint restrictions on the optimality of investment and consumption pose stringent conditions for candidate stochastic discount factors.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Stefanos Delikouras and Robert F Dittmar', 'eprint': 'http://webuser.bus.umich.edu/rdittmar/Research_files/Papers/productionOct2015.pdf', 'title': 'Does the Investment-based Model Explain Expected Returns?

The first part of this research project uses a general equilibrium model of an endowment economy with disappointment averse investors to explain the cross-section of postwar US equity returns. The proposed model relies heavily on disappointment events, that is periods during which consumption growth falls below its forward-looking certainty equivalent. These events seem to have predictive power over NBER recessions. The modelling framework does not rely on additional risk processes, backwards-looking state variables, or extremely persistent consumption shocks to explain equity returns. The only explanatory variable is realized consumption growth for the US economy. The estimated consumption asset pricing model …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Stefanos Delikouras', 'title': 'DISAPPOINTMENT AND EXTREME EVENTS IN ASSET PRICING', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11569046161470710301&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'year': 2012}, 'id_citations': 'sYN5D_EAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">We empirically investigate the ability of stochastic discount factors rooted in the investmentbased pricing theory to explain differences in equity risk premia across book-to-market-sorted portfolios. Our approach to this question is to specify the stochastic discount factor as lying in the linear span of firms’ investment returns. In contrast to previous theoretical results, we find that the model cannot empirically generate a value premium. However, our results indicate that this result is not due to the inability of the model to generate cross-sectional variation in risk across book-to-market-sorted portfolios. Value firms are riskier than growth firms, but the risk premium needed to generate the observed value premium is larger than can be generated by the investment-based model.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Stefanos Delikouras and Robert F Dittmar', 'eprint': 'http://webuser.bus.umich.edu/rdittmar/Research_files/Papers/Delikouras_Dittmar2011.pdf', 'title': 'Does the Investment-Based Model Explain the Value Premium?
