A logical next step in this evolution is to combine mixed-integer linear programming, constraint programming, and global optimization in a single system. Recent research in the area of integrated problem solving suggests that the right combination of different technologies can simplify modeling and speed up computation substantially. Nevertheless, integration often requires special-purpose coding, which is time consuming and error prone. We present a general-purpose solver, SIMPL, that allows its user to replicate (and sometimes improve on) the results of custom implementations with concise models written in a high-level language.

The use of high-level metaconstraints in the problem formulation can achieve a substantial share of these computational gains by better communicating problem structure to the solver. During the solution process, however, metaconstraints give rise to reformulations or relaxations that introduce auxiliary variables, and some of the variables in one metaconstraint’s reformulation may be functionally the same as or related to variables in another metaconstraint’s reformulation. These relationships must be recognized to obtain a tight overall relaxation. We propose a modeling scheme based on semantic typing that systematically addresses this problem while providing simpler, self-documenting models.

A good appointment schedule seeks to help outpatient clinics to utilize their resources efficiently while containing patients\' waiting times. The task of identifying an optimal schedule is modeled as a nonlinear integer program, where the objective function is the outcome of stochastic analysis in transient state. We maintain the discrete nature of the appointment scheduling problem by considering arrival epochs with discrete supports. By looking at discrete-time snapshots of the random evolution of a single-server queueing model, we characterize probabilistically the system\'s workload over time as a function of an appointment schedule and we derive recursive expressions for the performance measures of interest. Subsequently, we unfold discrete convexity properties of the optimization problem. We prove that under general conditions the objective function is supermodular and componentwise convex. Under assumptions on patient punctuality, we prove that the optimal scheduling strategy minimizes a multimodular function; a property which guarantees that a locally optimal schedule is also globally optimal. The size of the local neighborhood, however, grows exponentially with the dimension of the problem. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to develop and implement an algorithm for minimizing locally a multimodular function over nonnegative integer vectors via submodular set-function minimization over ring …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Christos Zacharias and Tallys Yunes', 'eprint': 'http://moya.bus.miami.edu/~czacharias/folder/ZachariasYunes2018.pdf', 'journal': 'Available at SSRN 3273649', 'title': 'Multimodularity in the stochastic appointment scheduling problem with discrete arrival epochs', 'url': 'https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3273649', 'year': 2018}, 'citedby': 3, 'id_citations': 'sQsGWTwAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '15262978544871925545', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"> <div class="gsh_csp">This chapter provides a brief survey of existing software tools that enable, facilitate, and/or support the integration of different optimization techniques.

We propose a new integer programming model for the TUP that generalizes the two best existing models, introduce new families of strong valid inequalities, and implement a branch-and-cut algorithm to solve instances from the TUP benchmark.

This thesis is composed of four papers in which the combination of Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and Constraint Programming (CP) is exploited to a greater or lesser extent. In the first paper, we identify a practical application for the global constraint sum, called the Sequence Dependent Cumulative Cost Problem (SDCCP), and we describe the convex hull of feasible solutions to sum. We also show that, from both a theoretical and computational point of view, models that use the sum constraint are superior to an alternative model for the SDCCP. In the second and third papers we design, implement and test an integrated modeling and solution system, which we call SIMPL. SIMPL’s main idea is to view traditional solution methods, as well as integrated methods, as special cases of a search-infer-and-relax framework. Computational experiments on three different problem classes indicate that SIMPL is generic enough to allow its user to implement a variety of complex integrated solution schemes with a high-level and concise modeling language. This means that, in many cases, it is no longer necessary to write special purpose code in order to exploit many of the benefits of an integrated approach. In two examples, our experiments show reductions in the number of search nodes and computation time, respectively, of a few orders of magnitude.</div><div class="gsh_csp">The fourth paper deals with a problem at the intersection of marketing and operations.
