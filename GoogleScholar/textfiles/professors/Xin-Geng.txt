Our interest is in examining the effect of routing policies on servers when they care about fairness among themselves, and when they can endogenously choose capacities in response to the routing policy. Therefore, we study the two‐server game where the servers’ objective functions have a term explicitly modeling fairness. Moreover, we focus on four commonly seen policies that are from one general class. Theoretical results concerning the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium are proved for some policies. Further managerial insights are given based on simulation studies on servers’ equilibrium/off‐equilibrium behaviors and the resulting system efficiency performance under different policies.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Xin Geng and Woonghee Tim Huh and Mahesh Nagarajan', 'eprint': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/poms.12305', 'journal': 'Production and Operations Management', 'number': '6', 'pages': '961-974', 'title': 'Fairness among servers when capacity decisions are endogenous', 'url': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12305', 'volume': '24', 'year': 2015}, 'citedby': 8, 'id_citations': '5FxxClIAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C', 'id_scholarcitedby': '1530904446636227562', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp"><i>Problem definition</i>: In a two-period model of a dyadic supply chain, we study the interaction between the use of strategic inventory withholding by the buyer and the use of a direct selling channel (encroachment) by the supplier in the second period. <i>Academic/practical relevance</i>: While the extant OM literature has individually examined the two strategies, the system-wide combined effect of these strategies has not been studied. <i>Methodology</i>: We fill the gap by building and analyzing two decentralized models of vertical competition. The main model focuses on sequential quantity decisions where the buyer decides on its order quantity and sets its selling quantity, with a first-mover advantage, before the supplier decides on its direct selling quantity. In an extension, we also consider an alternative timing structure of simultaneous quantity competition. <i>Results</i>: For the sequential model, we find that for any finite holding …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Huiqi Guan and Haresh Gurnani and Xin Geng and Yadong Luo', 'eprint': 'https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/msom.2018.0705', 'journal': 'Manufacturing & Service Operations Management', 'publisher': 'INFORMS', 'title': 'Strategic inventory and supplier encroachment', 'url': 'https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2018.0705', 'year': 2018}, 'citedby': 6, 'id_citations': '5FxxClIAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '7201444860076031032', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div><div><div class="gsh_csp">Opaque selling, whereby the firm hides some product attribute until payment is completed, is proved effective in maximizing profit if used with price discrimination.

Servers are quality-differentiated, where the quality can be improved based on the servers’ past experience. In such cases, the commonly used pricing scheme fails to effectively facilitate the quality improvement for servers and therefore impedes the firm’s future revenue increase. Motivated by the probabilistic selling strategy, we propose another pricing scheme where the firm does not disclose the server assignment to the customers until payment is made. With respect to the long-run total revenue, we compare the two schemes and establish the superiority of the one that we propose. Moreover, we investigate how the revenue advantage from the proposed pricing scheme is affected by the quality improvement process and the degree of vertical differentiation, both of which are important features in the setting.
