He argued that each performance’s audience must be segregated from the others for the performances to succeed. That is, an individual must “ensure that those before whom he plays one of his parts will not be the same individual before whom he plays a different part in another setting.” 3 Individuals preserve audience segregation by following the rules of decorum of each social situation and by filtering the information about themselves …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Patricia Sánchez Abril and Avner Levin and Alissa Del Riego', 'eprint': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1744-1714.2011.01127.x', 'journal': 'American Business Law Journal', 'number': '1', 'pages': '63-124', 'title': 'Blurred boundaries: Social media privacy and the twenty‐first‐century employee', 'url': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1744-1714.2011.01127.x', 'volume': '49', 'year': 2012}, 'citedby': 259, 'id_citations': 'EdMEy_MAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '13228877440572532244', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Consider the following three scenarios: First, James, an otherwise upstanding citizen, got uncharacteristically drunk at an office party.

Passionate about your employer, you put in long hours doing everything from marketing to accounting to event planning. You are also proud of your employer\'s product, so you begin to publicize it to your friends through your social network accounts.(In fact, the company\'s founder is also one of your Facebook friends.) You tell your friends about the product launch, invite them to marketing events, and eventually blog about your industry, amassing a significant social media following while creating buzz about your employer. But one day, during layoffs unrelated to your own efforts, you are fired. As you walk out the door, your supervisor asks you to return the office keys, your parking pass, and... administrative rights to your social media profiles.

Both coincide in granting the right of withdrawal to a special category of individuals, namely consumers, due to the situation of information asymmetry in which they find themselves vis-à-vis traders. In addition, the consumer can invoke this right when concluding particularly complex contracts (eg, consumer credit contracts) or in those cases in which he is subject to pressure or the so-called “surprise factor” at the time of entering into the contract (eg, door-to-door sales). However, beyond these coincidences, the European and US rights of withdrawal differ greatly in several aspects. To begin with, the European Union has been very generous and flexible when regulating this concept, while in the USA the legislation is quite a bit more restricted and limited. Hence, retail “return policies”, designed to offer consumers the option of returning merchandise for predetermined reasons within a stipulated period, play a vital role in understanding consumer withdrawal rights in the USA. These differences and many other issues will be addressed here with a view to determining whether US law might be used as a model to improve the regulation of the right of withdrawal in the EU.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Patricia Sánchez Abril and Francisco Oliva Blázquez and Joan Martínez Evora', 'eprint': 'https://www.raco.cat/index.php/InDret/article/download/341929/432991', 'journal': 'InDret', 'title': 'The Right of Withdrawal in Consumer Contracts: a comparative analysis of American and European law', 'url': 'https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3260506', 'volume': '3', 'year': 2018}, 'citedby': 2, 'id_citations': 'EdMEy_MAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '16844778100806310067', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">La Comisión Europea ha puesto de manifiesto la existencia de una percepción generalizada entre los sujetos en relación con los significativos riesgos que existen para ser protegidos, especialmente en el ámbito de las actividades online―propuestas de políticas y en especial Eurobarómetro (EB) 359, de protección de datos e identidad electrónica en la UE (protección de datos relacionados y la identidad electrónica en la UE, 2011)―.

The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA) requires that the complaint state “with particularity” facts giving rise to a “strong inference” that the defendant acted with the scienter required for the cause of action. Uniformly referred to in tandem as “motive and opportunity,” the presence of a motive behind the fraud, combined with the perpetrator’s opportunity to commit it has long been a method for establishing intent. As part of a motive and opportunity pleading, some plaintiffs have contended that greed-in the form of perpetuating a prestigious executive position, ensuring a gainful bonus, or maintaining the appearance of corporate profitability-is a bona fide motive evidencing scienter. Such allegations have met disparate and somewhat unreasoned fates. From the over one hundred reported Circuit Court cases interpreting the strong inference standard in a variety of factual settings this article proposes a framework for more orderly analysis of the sufficiency of allegations of corporate and personal avarice. Guided by a well-established model for consideration of insider trading, the contextual model identifies three dimensions-referred to as magnitude, timing, and atypicality-that can heighten ordinary profit-seeking activities to suspicious or unusual conduct, a motive that properly can give rise to a strong inference of scienter.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Patricia Sánchez Abril and Ann Morales Olazábal', 'journal': 'Florida Law Review', 'title': 'The Ubiquity of Greed: A Contextual Model for Analysis of Scienter', 'url': 'https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1392321', 'volume': '60', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'EdMEy_MAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">With no uniform jurisprudential roadmap, courts in civil securities fraud lawsuits have been applying widely divergent assumptions and methods for locating a defendant corporation’s scienter. This article posits a new conceptualization of corporate scienter in the 10 (b) setting, built upon the history, philosophical foundations, and evolution of corporate states of mind in the area of criminal law, a context that has necessarily seen various approaches to corporate scienter develop and flourish. Based on this new construct, the article proposes a rule that places in the locus of scienter a group of corporate agents whose personal scienter, by virtue of their participation in or link to the 10 (b) misrepresentation or omission, is indicative of the corporation’s. More importantly, the proposed rule recognizes the influence of corporate personality in the perpetration of wrongdoing and presumes that a corporation can be found to possess scienter of its own–temporally and physically independent from that of its constituent agents.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Patricia Sánchez Abril and Ann Morales Olazábal', 'journal': 'Columbia Business Law Review', 'title': 'The Locus of Corporate Scienter', 'url': 'https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1392238', 'volume': '1', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'EdMEy_MAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'author': 'Troy A Groetken and Timothy R Holbrook and Sean Seymore and Donald L Zuhn Jr and Patricia S Abril and Jonathan Darrow and Peter Ludlow and J Michael Monahan', 'title': 'Michael H.
