The empirical analysis focuses on industrial metals with and without futures contracts and is organized around two key themes. First, I show that the comovement between metals with and without futures contracts has not weakened in recent years as speculative activity has risen. Specifically, the annual and quarterly price growth rates of the two metal categories have been positively correlated with their growth rates experiencing a structural shift by the end of 2002. This comovement is driven by economic fundamentals because world GDP growth is strongly correlated with metal price growth, especially after 2002. The structural change in 2002 is also consistent with supply and demand information found in industry newsletters. In the second set of results, I focus more directly on financial speculation and spot price inflation. I use the S&amp;P Goldman-Sachs Commodity Index returns to proxy for the volume of speculative activity and I show that these returns are unrelated to metal prices. The final test follows storage models, which suggest that speculation can affect spot markets only if it leads to physical hoarding. Focusing on metals with established futures markets, I find no evidence of physical hoarding because inventory growth is found to be negatively correlated with price growth rates.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'George M Korniotis', 'eprint': 'https://www.federalreserve.gov/Pubs/feds/2009/200929/200929pap.pdf', 'publisher': 'Division of Research & Statistics and Monetary Affairs, Federal Reserve Board', 'title': 'Does Speculation Affect Spot Price Levels?: The Case of Metals with and Without Futures Markets', 'url': 'https://www.federalreserve.gov/Pubs/feds/2009/200929/200929pap.pdf', 'year': 2009}, 'citedby': 21, 'id_citations': 'xhL6h8AAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '4942907225923874643', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'author': 'GM Korniotis', 'journal': 'Department of Finance, University of Notre Dame', 'title': 'A dynamic panel estimator with both fixed and spatial effects', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2862146600642341341&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'year': 2005}, 'citedby': 19, 'id_citations': 'xhL6h8AAAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C', 'id_scholarcitedby': '2862146600642341341', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Using information from 10-K filings of public firms, we identify economic connections among US states.

These findings suggest that shocks to locally-dominant firms drive aggregate economic fluctuations.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Sima Jannati and George M Korniotis and Alok Kumar', 'eprint': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sima_Jannati2/publication/314597978_Big_Fish_in_a_Small_Pond_Locally-Dominant_Firms_and_the_Business_Cycle/links/5b364485a6fdcc8506dc963c/Big-Fish-in-a-Small-Pond-Locally-Dominant-Firms-and-the-Business-Cycle.pdf', 'journal': 'Available at SSRN 2884737', 'title': 'Big Fish in a Small Pond: Locally-Dominant Firms and the Business Cycle', 'url': 'https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2884737', 'year': 2018}, 'citedby': 4, 'id_citations': 'xhL6h8AAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '971937241945619551', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">We find that about 25% of stockholders enter/exit non-retirement investment accounts biennially. To examine this participation turnover, we estimate a canonical portfolio choice model. The estimation reveals that income risk and time costs to investing, estimated at 3.7% of income, affect the turnover in stock ownership. Further, the estimates of the coefficient of relative risk aversion and the discount factor are 3.176 and 0.963, respectively. Finally, the model implies that consumption CAPMs can perform better when focusing on investors who rarely exit the market because their consumption growth is the most volatile and the most correlated with market returns.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Yosef Bonaparte and George M Korniotis and Alok Kumar', 'title': 'Portfolio choice and asset pricing with investor entry and exit', 'url': 'https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2972173', 'year': 2018}, 'citedby': 4, 'id_citations': 'xhL6h8AAAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '8558368536687427908', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Contrary to the predictions of traditional life-cycle models, household consumption is excessively sensitive to current income. Similarly, weak evidence of income hedging runs against standard portfolio theory. We link these two puzzles by modifying the theoretical framework of Viceira (2001) to study how consumption-income sensitivities generated by income in the utility function impact household portfolio choice. Empirically, we fi nd that consumption-income sensitivities affect asset allocation through the income hedging motive. In particular, we show that the interaction between consumption-income sensitivity and the correlation of income growth to stock market returns is an important explanatory variable for households\' stock market holdings.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Jawad M Addoum and Stefanos Delikouras and George M Korniotis', 'eprint': 'http://addoum.dyson.cornell.edu/docs/ray005.pdf', 'journal': 'Available at SSRN 2409209', 'title': 'Consumption-Income Sensitivity and Portfolio Choice', 'url': 'https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2409209', 'year': 2018}, 'citedby': 4, 'id_citations': 'xhL6h8AAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '12018684544333056999', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">This paper deals with the industry of solar water heaters in Cyprus. We first introduce a brief review of the historical development followed by an analysis of the Cypriot solar industrial environment. The role of the Cyprus standards and of the energy department is examined. The basic characteristics of the market of the solar industry including details regarding price inputs; suppliers and technology are presented. An investigation concerning the habits and preferences of the Cypriots towards solar products is described together with a detailed analysis of the production and economic cycle of the solar industry. Finally the impact of solar collectors on the Cyprus energy balance will be considered. The main sources of information were derived from surveys of the department a/statistics and interviews with the managers a/the largest factories of the island.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'George Korniotis and Kyriacos Kalli and Constantinos Christofides', 'eprint': 'https://energystudiesreview.ca/esr/article/view/417/397', 'journal': 'Energy Studies Review', 'number': '2', 'pages': '66-85', 'publisher': 'MCMASTER INSTITUTE FOR ENERGY STUDIES', 'title': 'Solar-Collector Industry in Cyprus: Techno-Economic Analysis and Future Perspectives', 'url': 'https://energystudiesreview.ca/esr/article/view/417', 'volume': '9', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 4, 'id_citations': 'xhL6h8AAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C', 'id_scholarcitedby': '620246970723017818', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">This paper extends the traditional life-cycle hypothesis to allow for rewards from consumption and savings. In the new model, the utility function depends both on consumption and savings, resulting in differing marginal propensities to consume (DMPC) from current income, current wealth, and future income. Specifically, consumption is financed mostly by current income. The model explains various empirical regularities not captured by the traditional life-cycle model including the hypersensitivity of consumption to current income shocks, and the drop in individual consumption at the time of retirement.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Stefanos Delikouras and George M Korniotis', 'title': 'Consuming, Saving, and Spending Most of Income', 'url': 'https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=608367', 'year': 2017}, 'citedby': 3, 'id_citations': 'xhL6h8AAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C', 'id_scholarcitedby': '7370277425373077320', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">We propose a theoretical measure of income hedging demand and show that it affects asset prices.

To investigate why, we follow the psychology literature on memory, which indicates that individuals recall their first (primacy) and last (recency) decisions. Reliance on these decisions can hinder learning and optimal updating. We find that portfolio decisions made near the account opening and in the most recent period significantly influence investors\' future choices. Memory effects are strong, leading to a 3.16% reduction in performance during the months when investors trade.
