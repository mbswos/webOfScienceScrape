In addition, the realized values are also private information. We characterize a class of environments in which the profit-maximizing long-term contract offered by a monopolist takes an especially simple structure: we derive sufficient conditions on primitives under which the optimal contract consists of a menu of deterministic sequences of static contracts. Within each sequence, higher realized values lead to greater quantity provision; however, an increasing proportion of buyer types are excluded over time, eventually leading to inefficiently early termination of the relationship. Moreover, the menu choices differ by future generosity, with more costly (up front) plans guaranteeing greater quantity provision in the future.

Schools compete to place graduates by investing in education quality and by choosing grading policies. In equilibrium, schools strategically adopt grading policies that do not perfectly reveal graduate ability to evaluators. We compare outcomes when schools grade strategically to outcomes when evaluators perfectly observe graduate ability. With strategic grading, grades are less informative, and evaluators rely less on grades and more on a school\'s quality when assessing graduates. Consequently, under strategic grading, schools have greater incentive to invest in quality, and this can improve evaluator welfare.

Intervention erodes the value of an investor’s private information by weakening the link between the initial state and the asset payoff. Informed investors are reluctant to make large, informative trades in the bad state, undermining the market’s informativeness and the welfare gains generated by the possibility of a corrective intervention. Fundamentally, the authority faces a tradeoff between eliciting information from the asset market and using the information so obtained. The authority can generate a Pareto improvement if she commits to intervene less often when the market suggests that intervention is most beneficial and more often when the market suggests that intervention is unwarranted. She thus may benefit from imperfections in the intervention process or from delegating the decision to intervene to a biased agent.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'RAPHAEL BOLESLAVSKY DAVID L KELLY CURTIS and R TAYLOR', 'eprint': 'http://www.raphaelboleslavsky.com/s/Jet_Final.pdf', 'title': 'Selloffs, Bailouts, and Feedback: Can Asset Markets Inform Policy?', 'url': 'http://www.raphaelboleslavsky.com/s/Jet_Final.pdf', 'year': 2014}, 'citedby': 12, 'id_citations': 'opu4fisAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '13659804100466019091', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">We develop a game theoretic model of price competition in which an innovating firm can offer product demonstrations.

We develop a model in which citizens engage in a regime change global game, and media freedom is a ruler’s instrument for Bayesian persuasion, used to manage the competing risks of coups and protests. A coup switches the status quo from being in the ruler’s favor to being against him.

Posting a standard DRM in an environment with a securities market endogenously increases the outside option of the informed agent. If the informed agent rejects said DRM, then she convinces the market that she is uninformed, and she can trade aggressively sans price impact, generating large (off-equilibrium) trading gains. Due to this endogenous outside option effect, using a DRM to screen out uninformed agents may be impossible. Even when screening is possible, refraining from posting a mechanism and instead relying on markets for information is optimal if the endogenous change in outside option value is sufficiently large. Finally, even if posting a DRM dominates relying on markets, outcomes are improved by introducing a search friction, which randomly limits the agent\'s ability to observe the DRM, forcing the firm to sometimes rely on markets for information.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Raphael Boleslavsky and Christopher Hennessy and David L Kelly', 'eprint': 'https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/aff8/a8f944da5da002a45c8dce10129dbfd600a6.pdf', 'journal': 'Mechanisms (September 27, 2017)', 'title': 'Markets vs. Mechanisms', 'url': 'https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3043848', 'year': 2017}, 'id_citations': 'opu4fisAAAAJ:IUKN3-7HHlwC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr">Page 1.
