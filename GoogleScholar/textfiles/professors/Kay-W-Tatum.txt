We do not find evidence that the regulatory change significantly affected investors’ reaction to the release of auditors’ reports, audit fees, or audit quality.

We investigate the one-year effect of the new report in terms of the cost of audits, audit quality, and investors’ reaction to the report’s filing.

In Interpretation 15, ARSC set forth various attributes or characteristics to be considered when determining what is and is not a financial statement. Among these attributes were presentation titles, accounting equation format, and articulation. In Interpretation 16, ARSC developed a precise boundary at which the submission of a financial statement occurs. Regarding draft financial statements, ARSC developed Interpretation 17, which recognizes that draft financial statements are appropriate when the accountant intends to submit final financial statements, accompanied by the appropriate report, and labels each page of the draft financial statements as a" …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Kay W Tatum and Alan J Winters', 'eprint': 'http://search.proquest.com/openview/7f0af17edd3a9bca521e38c7e0579d13/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=41798', 'journal': 'The CPA Journal', 'number': '2', 'pages': '8', 'publisher': 'New York State Society of Certified Public Accountants', 'title': 'Compilation and Review Services: Answers to Questions Old and New', 'url': 'http://search.proquest.com/openview/7f0af17edd3a9bca521e38c7e0579d13/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=41798', 'volume': '61', 'year': 1991}, 'id_citations': 'yYo0BBMAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Frequently, companies are issuing keep-well agreements (" comfort letters") undertaken to comfort another party with regard to a contingent liability. The legal question surrounding these agreements is whether they contain an enforceable promise. Case law reveals that the letter writer escapes the traditional guarantee promises by refusing to write the" magic" words that bind it. One financial institute classified these letters as Grade A, B, or C, depending on the promises involved. According to a review of case law, comfort letters have commercial significance. Many courts are ruling that, in some cases, these letters do contain binding promises similar to traditional guarantees, and, therefore, may be considered a loss contingency. When comfort letters have been issued, the auditor\'s primary concern is failing to discover a material contingent liability not disclosed in the financial statements and, thus, being associated …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Rene Sacasas and Kay Tatum and Don Wiesner', 'eprint': 'http://search.proquest.com/openview/5734b5cc24b47e3d8e646a05ef27ec73/1.pdf?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=41798', 'journal': 'The CPA Journal', 'number': '11', 'pages': '46', 'publisher': 'New York State Society of Certified Public Accountants', 'title': 'Keep-Well Letters: The Elusive Contingency', 'url': 'http://search.proquest.com/openview/5734b5cc24b47e3d8e646a05ef27ec73/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=41798', 'volume': '59', 'year': 1989}, 'id_citations': 'yYo0BBMAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Special reports must be prepared in accordance with Statement on Auditing Standards (SAS) 62.

Several events associated with its issuance suggested that auditors possibly were experiencing various problems implementing its requirements. The specific objectives of this study were to: 1. Determine the major audit sampling problems in current audits based on frequency of occurrence 2. Determine if the frequency of audit sampling problems was related to a statistical versus a nonstatistical approach or a high versus low level of continuing professional education (CPE) 3. Determine if the frequency of audit sampling problems in current and past audits was different  4. Determine the nature and extent of audit sampling methods in current audits 5. Compare the frequency of audit sampling problems and methods in compliance and substantive tests  6. Determine the effect of the SAS No. 39 requirements on the audit process. There were 1,988 public accounting firms surveyed. This population was divided into four strata: largest firms, other large firms. Division firms, and other small firms. Data analysis included descriptive statistics and t-tests.  Survey results relative to each objective were: 1. Eight (fourteen) considerations and procedures performed in compliance (substantive) tests were determined to be major problems. 2. Frequencies of problems were significantly greater for the largest firms using a nonstatistical approach and the other small firms providing a high level of CPE to their audit staffs. 3. Frequency of problems in current audits decreased significantly for the largest and other small firms. 4. Within a stratum the firms\' approaches to testing …</div></div>', 'author': 'Kay Ward Tatum', 'eprint': 'https://ttu-ir.tdl.org/ttu-ir/bitstream/handle/2346/9482/31295005008775.pdf;sequence=1', 'title': 'An empirical study of audit sampling problems', 'url': 'https://ttu-ir.tdl.org/handle/2346/9482', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'yYo0BBMAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC', 'source': 'citations'}]
