We argue that an increase in the number of regional governments has two effects: (1) it redistributes fiscal and administrative resources to underserved regions and (2) encourages yardstick competition. Extreme government fragmentation, however, limits efficiency gains by reducing administrative capacity, economies of scale, and enabling capture. We test this argument using original data on the number of regional governments in sub-Saharan Africa (1960–2012). Consistent with our theoretical expectations, we find robust evidence for an initial increase in the quality of services provision following regional government splits, which levels off at high levels of regional fragmentation. Three distinct difference-in-difference analyses of microlevel, georeferenced data on health outcomes in Malawi, Nigeria, and Uganda …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Guy Grossman and Jan H Pierskalla and Emma Boswell Dean', 'eprint': 'https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.1086/690305', 'journal': 'The Journal of Politics', 'number': '3', 'pages': '823-840', 'publisher': 'University of Chicago Press', 'title': 'Government fragmentation and public goods provision', 'url': 'https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/690305', 'volume': '79', 'year': 2017}, 'citedby': 19, 'id_citations': 'hxM5sDEAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C', 'id_scholarcitedby': '2130938806912088544', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Economic growth has lifted billions out of poverty in the span of a few generations. Despite these positive trends, poverty remains entrenched for millions around the globe. One long-standing explanation for poverty’s persistence is the possibility of poverty traps, or self-reinforcing cycles of poverty. Theoretical models of such poverty traps—often centered on nutrition in the earliest cases—have been central in the development literature for over half a century (Leibenstein 1957; Mirrlees 1975; Stiglitz 1976; Bliss and Stern 1978; Dasgupta and Ray 1986). This literature has expanded in many directions to consider the varying potential underlying forces such as geographic characteristics, pecuniary externalities, and even cultural forces, as well as both theoretical and policy implications of such traps, ranging from intergenerational transmission of poverty to equilibrium unemployment (Jalan and Ravallion 2002; Sachs 2005; Fang and Loury 2005; Currie and Almond 2011; Barrett and Carter 2013; Sachs 2014; Kraay and Raddatz 2007). 1</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Emma Dean and Frank Schilbach and Heather Schofield', 'eprint': 'https://basis.ucdavis.edu/sites/g/files/dgvnsk466/files/inline-files/NBER_Conference_Slides-Schofield.pdf', 'title': 'Poverty and cognitive function', 'url': 'http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=gLB4DwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA57&dq=info:WUypU8kga1kJ:scholar.google.com&ots=gdnMTpt3gI&sig=2mfvHSGjU8N3uAMdlzjPiEiBLkI', 'year': 2016}, 'citedby': 18, 'id_citations': 'hxM5sDEAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C', 'id_scholarcitedby': '6443279740947745881', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr">Contributors M.
