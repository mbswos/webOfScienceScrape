The empirical analysis focuses on differences in search behavior between the employed and unemployed. A key finding of the analysis is that the offer rate per contact is greater for employed searchers than for unemployed searchers. This may be due to differences in the effectiveness of search while employed versus unemployed or to unobserved differences in search effort.

The simulations indicate that a refundable child care tax credit would distribute child care benefits more equally across the population by increasing the shares of subsidies received by low-income families, and would induce a considerable increase in expenditures on market child care.

Although hundreds of millions of dollars were spent on the earlier programs, the experiments probably had only a negligible impact on policies. This result stemmed from a variety of factors: Social testing actually tends to exert a conservative influence on policymaking; and the time required to complete experiments and interpret results is often incompatible with the needs of policy makers.

As a consequence, policymakers have increasingly turned their attention to child care issues. In 1987, for example, more than seventy bills (representing close to fifty distinct pieces of legislation) were introduced into Congress with provisions for child care. In 1990, the first federal child care legislation since World War II was enacted. While a major step forward, many feel there is a further need for federal involvement. Although child care issues are complex and wide ranging, they appear to center around three notions: quality, availability, and affordability. In essence, the problem is one of ensuring access to decent and affordable child care for the more than 25 million children of working mothers. Because the child care needs of the population are so diverse, finding a long-lasting solution to this problem represents a significant national challenge. Economists have recently discovered that they have much to contribute to the public debate on child care. Although child care research has a long history in sociology, psychology, and education, it is only recently that economists have begun seri-ously to address many of the central policy issues in this area. The purpose of this chapter is to describe the economic approach to child care and to show how economic research can be (and is being] used to shed light on several key child care policy issues.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Philip K Robins', 'journal': 'The economics of child care', 'pages': '11-42', 'publisher': 'New York: Russell Sage Foundation', 'title': 'Child care policy and research: an economist’s perspective', 'url': 'http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=jQW5BgAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA11&dq=info:OtPIY9w2BPgJ:scholar.google.com&ots=R6DsTXD_i5&sig=CBax97SzacRKLCVTsZ1TxPcqlGY', 'year': 1991}, 'citedby': 48, 'id_citations': 'n0WnuCwAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '17871469541507781434', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">This report presents the final results on the implementation, impacts, costs, and economic benefits of the UK Employment Retention and Advancement (ERA) programme. ERA’s distinctive combination of post-employment advisory support and financial incentives was designed to help low-income individuals who entered work sustain employment and advance in the labor market. Launched in 2003 in selected Jobcentre Plus offices, ERA targeted three groups: unemployed lone parents receiving Income Support and volunteering for the New Deal for Lone Parents welfare-to-work programme, lone parents working part time and receiving Working Tax Credit, and long-term unemployed people aged 25 or older receiving Job seeker’s Allowance who were required to participate in the New Deal 25 Plus welfare-to-work programme. The effectiveness of the programme was evaluated using a random assignment research design.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Richard Hendra and James A Riccio and Richard Dorsett and David H Greenberg and Genevieve Knight and Joan Phillips and Philip K Robins and Sandra Vegeris and Johanna Walter and Kathryn Ray and Jared Smith and Aaron Hill', 'eprint': 'https://westminsterresearch.westminster.ac.uk/download/47c9b0d3478992b3356547e23396b3ff3d27c34249e0f92bd7d543102598bcd9/4037627/Hendra_et_al_2011.pdf', 'journal': 'No-Pay Cycle: Final Evidence from the UK Employment Retention and Advancement (ERA) Demonstration (October 12, 2011)', 'title': 'Breaking the low-pay, no-pay cycle: Final evidence from the UK Employment Retention and Advancement (ERA) demonstration', 'url': 'https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1943253', 'year': 2011}, 'citedby': 47, 'id_citations': 'n0WnuCwAAAAJ:_xSYboBqXhAC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '1019129648421971095', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div><div><div class="gsh_csp">Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), we investigate whether certain aspects of personal appearance (i.e., physical attractiveness, personality, and grooming) affect a student\'s cumulative grade point average (GPA) in high school. When physical attractiveness is entered into the model as the only measure of personal appearance (as has been done in previous studies), it has a positive and statistically significant impact on GPA for female students and a positive yet not statistically significant effect for male students. Including personality and grooming, the effect of physical attractiveness turns negative for both groups, but is only statistically significant for males. For male and female students, being very well groomed is associated with a statistically significant GPA premium.

Often, the success or failure of these programs is judged on the basis of whether the calculated net benefits to society are positive or negative. Almost all existing benefit–cost studies of social programs count entire increases in income accruing to participants in a social program as net benefits to society. However, economic theory implies that the conceptually appropriate measure of the impact of a government program on any group of individuals is the net change in their surplus (or economic rent), rather than the net change in their income. For example, if a social program causes increases in income by increasing work hours, then the lost nonmarket time that accompanies these increases has value that needs to be counted as a cost when assessing the merits of that program.

At the present time there are statutes governing the maximum allowable interest rate which a lender can charge an individual on a residential home mortgage loan in all but five states. These statutory rates vary appreciably among the states ranging from a low of 7-\'2 per cent in New York, New Jersey, and Vermont to a high of 21 per cent in Rhode Island.

The philosophical underpinning of the child support assurance program being piloted in the state of Wisconsin is that all parents are required to share their income with their children. The program has five components. First, the sharing rate for noncustodial parents is specified by administrative code and depends almost exclusively on the number of children owed support. Second, the resulting child support obligation is withheld from wages and other sources of income just like income taxes and payroll taxes. Third, the child is entitled to either the child support paid by the noncustodial parent or an assured benefit, whichever is higher. Fourth, the child\'s custodial parent is entitled to a wage subsidy of $1 per hour worked-up to a maximum of $2000 per year. The full subsidy is paid to those with family income equal to less than $8000 and gradually taxed back so that no subsidy is paid to those with family income above $16,000. Fifth, if the noncustodial parent pays less than the assured benefit, the state supplements the payment up to an amount equal to the assured benefit, and the custodial parent becomes liable for a small payment to offset the public subsidy.</div><div class="gsh_csp">The child support assurance program (CSAP) is expected to increase private child support payments, increase the economic security of custodial-parent families, and reduce their dependence on government at little extra cost and perhaps even some small savings to the state.

Unfortunately, attempted solutions have often targeted one of these conditions while exacerbating the other. Indeed, the history of social welfare policy is characterized by an oscillation between efforts to alleviate poverty and attempts to decrease welfare dependence. As poverty is decreased by raising welfare benefits, dependence grows. But when dependence is minimized by cutting benefits, families who remain dependent on social assistance fall deeper into poverty.</div><div class="gsh_csp">This dilemma is reflected in the experience of welfare-dependent families.

The supplement is available to single parents who have received income assistance for a year or more, and typically doubles the gross take-home pay of recipients. A critical issue in the evaluation of SSP is whether the availability of the supplement would lead some new income assistance recipients to prolong their stay on welfare in order to gain eligibility. A separate experiment was conducted to measure the magnitude of this effect. One half of a group of new applicants was informed that they would be eligible to receive SSP if they stayed on income assistance for a year; the other half was randomly assigned to a control group.

Unlike simple random assignment, the Conlisk-Watts model results in an experimental sample in which household characteristics are not orthogonal to experimental treatments and experimental treatments are not orthogonal to each other.

During this period the proportion of all single-parent families receiving AFDC fell (reversing an earlier twodecade trend) and real child support collections also fell. Analysis of the CPS data reveals that from 1978 to 1981 the decline in the AFDC participation rate can be attributed to an erosion in real AFDC guarantee levels caused by high rates of inflation and to changes in demographic conditions, while from 1981 to 1983 the decline can be attributed entirely to the provision of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 that raised effective AFDC tax rates. The analysis also reveals that a sizable reduction in labor supply occurred in response to OBRA, in contrast to earlier studies of this issue. If work effort had not been reduced, the results suggest that OBRA would have caused a much larger decline in the AFDC participation rate than actually occurred. The analysis also reveals that the decreased child support collections over the 1978-83 period were the result of an erosion of real child support award amounts. This decrease in child support collections led to a small increase in AFDC participation that offset somewhat the downward trend in AFDC participation, but only in the first part of that period: from 1978 to 1981, real child support collections fell by 17 percent,) generating an increase in the AFDC participation rate of about one percentage point; from 1981 to 1983, child support collections increased slightly, but had no perceivable effect on the AFDC …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Philip K Robins', 'number': '87', 'publisher': 'University of Wisconsin-Madison, Institute for Research on Poverty', 'title': 'An Analysis of Trends in Child Support and AFDC from 1978 to 1983', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1174548424248116710&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 17, 'id_citations': 'n0WnuCwAAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '1174548424248116710', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Child care has become an increasingly important public policy issue in recent years.

The authors investigate whether AFDC benefit levels are systematically related to the family-size decisions of never-married women. Using a Poisson regression model, applied to Current Population Survey data for the years 1980–1988, they find that the basic benefit level positively influences family size for white and Hispanic women, but not for black women. Incremental benefits for larger families, however, do not affect family-size decisions, suggesting that reducing (or eliminating) this differential will not necessarily reduce the number of illegitimate births. The basic benefit level positively affects the family-size decisions of high school dropouts, but not of high school graduates. This suggests that to discourage nonmarital births, policymakers should consider altering the AFDC benefit structure in such a way as to encourage single mothers to complete high school. However, being a high school dropout might be a proxy for some other underlying characteristic of the woman, and inducing women to complete high school who otherwise would not might have no effect whatsoever on nonmarital births.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Philip K Robins and Paul Fronstin', 'eprint': 'https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/6649256.pdf', 'publisher': 'Institute for Research on Poverty, University of Wisconsin--Madison', 'title': 'Welfare benefits and family-size decisions of never-married women', 'url': 'https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/6649256.pdf', 'year': 1993}, 'citedby': 13, 'id_citations': 'n0WnuCwAAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '17268177881335536146', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Perhaps no other area of social policy has received as much attention in recent years as child support enforcement, for at least two reasons. First, as documented by Garfinkel and Mclanahan (1986) and others, poverty has become increasingly concentrated in single-parent families. Second, nationwide surveys (see US Department of Commerce, 1987, 1988, for example) have revealed that most single-parent families receive little, if any, financial assistance from the absent parent. Hence, a large number of such families are forced to rely on welfare for means of support. Because women heading single-parent families generally have low wage rates and low labor force attachment, and because the bulk of their support comes from public sources, child support enforcement has taken on the dual role of being both an antipoverty device and a mechanism for reducing welfare program costs. Over the past decade and a half, numerous pieces of legislation have been enacted to facilitate the child support enforcement process. The landmark legislation was passed in 1975, when the Child Support Enforcement (or Title IV-D) program was established. Since 1975, the IV-D program has undergone changes in order to strengthen its basic provisions. Two of the most important changes occurred with the passage of the 1984 Child Support Amendments and the 1988 Family Support Act. The 1984 amendments authorized wage withholding of child support when payment is delinquent and required states to develop specific guidelines for the establishment of child support awards.

Analysis of the CPS data reveals thatfrom 1978 to 1981, the decline in the AFDC participation rate can be attributed to an erosion in real AFDC guarantee levels caused by high rates of inflation and to changes in demographic conditions, while from 1981 to 1983 the decline can be attributed entirely to the provision of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1981 (OBRA), which raised effective AFDC benefit-reduction rates.

The approach is to specify a life cycle model of fertility and employment decisionmaking that incorporates child care costs.  Analysis of the model yields predictions concerning the effects of child care costs on fertility and employment timing.  A sample of labor market and birth histories is used to estimate empirically the effects of child care costs on the time of fertility and employment decisions.  1 of the strengths of the data set used is that several explicit measures of child care costs are available.  The empirical analysis is reduced form in nature but is closely related to the theoretical model.  The empirical results reveal that child care costs have significant effects on both fertility and employment timing and that these effects often are consistent with the predictions of the theoretical model.  Higher child care costs raise the birthrate for employed women although the effect is small and insigifnicant and reduce it for nonemployed women.  The effect for nonemployed women is contrary to the theoretical model which predicts that higher child care costs would increase the birthrate of nonemployed women.  Hiomen.  High child care costs also increase the rate of leaving employment and reduce the rate of entering employment.  Both effects are statistically significant and consistent with the theory.

Knowledge of the labor supply effects of the experiments is critical because changes in labor supply directly affect program costs and may also alter the struc-ture of the labor force in the United States. Failure to take labor supply adjustments into account when designing a national program may result in incorrect evaluations of the merits of competing proposals. The feasibility and desirability of any national income-maintenance program depends on its social and economic costs and its ability to satisfy three often contradictory goals. These goals are:(a) desirable social and economic incentives,(b) an equitable benefit structure, and (c) adequate minimum benefits. The cost of such a program, and the importance of the social and economic incentives implicit in its design, depend critically on the effects it may have on individuals’ behavior.</div><div class="gsh_csp">In order to make use of the information provided by experimental data in the design of a national program, it is necessary to develop a methodology for extrapolating the experimental results to a national population.

During the late 1960s and early 1970s, a significant portion of this attention was devoted to the working poor, particularly those in two-parent families. In recent years, however, poverty has become increasingly concentrated in singleparent families, and as a result attention has turned to this group." Virtually all children in poor single-parent families have an absent parent.” Because of this, most of the recent state and federal legislation directed toward single-parent families has been in the area of child support enforcement. The purpose of such legislation has been to attempt to shift some of the financial burden of the support of young children from the government to the absent parent. The first major piece of legislation in this area was in 1975, when Congress established the Child Support Enforcement Program as Part D of Title IV (IV-D) of the Social Security Act. The IV-D legislation requires each state to develop a child support enforcement program that provides services for establishing paternity, locating absent parents, establishing child support obligations, and enforcing such obligations. The states are required to pro-vide these services to all AFDC families and to non-AFDC families who request such services.

Faced with a loss of welfare benefits, many recipients may find that part‐time earnings do not allow them to be economically self‐sufficient. © 2001 by the Association of Public Policy Analysis and Management.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Philip K Robins and Charles Michalopoulos and Elsie Pan', 'eprint': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/1520-6688(200124)20:1%3C129::AID-PAM1007%3E3.0.CO;2-M', 'journal': 'Journal of Policy Analysis and Management: The Journal of the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management', 'number': '1', 'pages': '129-150', 'publisher': 'John Wiley & Sons, Inc.', 'title': 'Financial incentives and welfare reform in the United States', 'url': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/1520-6688(200124)20:1%3C129::AID-PAM1007%3E3.0.CO;2-M', 'volume': '20', 'year': 2001}, 'citedby': 6, 'id_citations': 'n0WnuCwAAAAJ:M05iB0D1s5AC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '10106618422874167689', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">As Merton (1967) elaborates in his treatise on social theory and social structure, there exists a reciprocal relationship between social theory and social research. On its surface, this statement appears straightforward and obvious, but as Merton goes on to describe, the actual implementation and elaboration of the proposed bidirectionality of the two prove troublesome. He states,“This... account has... pointed to the need for a closer connection between theory and empirical research. The prevailing division of the two is manifested in marked discontinuities of empirical research, on the one hand, and systematic theorizing unsustained by empirical test, on the other (pg. 99).” This is the case in recent research on the life course.

This is reversing an earlier two‐decade trend. This paper uses data from the Current Population Survey so as to investigate the reasons for the decline. The analysis reveals that for the years prior to 1981, the decline has resulted both from an erosion in real AFDC guarantee levels–caused by high rates of inflation–and from changes in demographic conditions. For the years subsequent to 1981, the decline has resulted from an increase in effective AFDC benefit reduction rates caused by the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1981. Somewhat offsetting the participation rate decline were falling real child support collections and a rising unemployment rate.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Philip K Robins', 'eprint': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1465-7287.1990.tb00585.x', 'journal': 'Contemporary Economic Policy', 'number': '1', 'pages': '110-123', 'publisher': 'Blackwell Publishing Ltd', 'title': 'A Decade of Declining Welfare Participation: Sorting Out the Causes', 'url': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1465-7287.1990.tb00585.x', 'volume': '8', 'year': 1990}, 'citedby': 6, 'id_citations': 'n0WnuCwAAAAJ:g5m5HwL7SMYC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '13174332556600023910', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><h3 class="gsh_h3">Background:</h3><div class="gsh_csp"> The United Kingdom Employment Retention and Advancement (U.K. ERA) demonstration was the largest and most comprehensive social experiment ever conducted in the United Kingdom.

In this paper, we use data from the 1990 National Child Care Survey, the 1990 Profile in Child Care Settings Study, and a contextual data file to examine the sensitivity of estimated price elasticities of child care demand to variable measurement, sample selection, and model specification. Our evidence suggests that the choice of instruments used to predict prices may matter when estimating child-care price elasticities. We extend on previous analyses by estimating models based on a set of price variables available in few current data sets-one containing parent reports for both the prices of modes currently being used and those not currently being used. We find that estimated elasticities based on this more extensive measure of prices are more precise than those obtained using conventional measures of prices and we find no evidence that using the more extensive measure produces biased estimates. Our results also suggest that estimated elasticities based on the more extensive measure of prices vary by child-care mode, the employment status of the mother, and by whether one controls for the endogeneity of the mother’s employment status.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Duncan D Chaplin and Philip K Robins and Sandra L Hofferth and Douglas A Wissoker and Paul Fronstin', 'eprint': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Duncan_Chaplin/publication/297428141_The_Price_Elasticity_of_Childcare_Demand_A_Sensitivity_Analysis/links/5709606308aea66081358951/The-Price-Elasticity-of-Childcare-Demand-A-Sensitivity-Analysis', 'journal': 'Manuscript, The Urban Institute, Washington DC', 'title': 'The Price Elasticity of Child Care Demand', 'url': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Duncan_Chaplin/publication/297428141_The_Price_Elasticity_of_Childcare_Demand_A_Sensitivity_Analysis/links/5709606308aea66081358951/The-Price-Elasticity-of-Childcare-Demand-A-Sensitivity-Analysis', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 5, 'id_citations': 'n0WnuCwAAAAJ:tYavs44e6CUC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '10418799648323968009', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr">By Charles Michalopoulos and Philip K.

This is in part because virtually all welfare or public transfer programs have benefit structures that depend on family type (ie, married, female-headed, single individual) and family size. Similarly, the federal income tax rate and many state and local tax rates are determined by family size and type.(In many tax systems both the marginal and average tax rates depend on family size and type.) Tax and transfer programs are likely to affect the demand for children because they affect disposable income and because they both directly and indirectly af. fect the costs of having and raising children. Understanding the relationship between public policy and fertility decisions is important because changes in fertility rates have important effects on the rate of population growth and on the age structure of the population, and both of these demographic factors in turn have significant influences on social, economic, and political phenomena." Recently, there has been interest in replacing the existing public welfare system with a nationwide NIT. An important question arises in designing such a program; specifically, what would the impact of an NIT on fertility be? This is important because the children of the poor are more likely to be poor themselves (when reaching adulthood) and, consequently, the eventual size of the poverty population may depend on the effects of an NIT on fertility.(See, eg, the theoretical work of Becker and …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'MICHAEL C Keeley and PK Robins and RG Spiegelman and S Weiner and JG Bell', 'journal': 'A Guaranteed Annual Income: Evidence from a Social Experiment', 'publisher': 'Academic Press New York', 'title': 'Demand for children', 'url': 'http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=1nqLBQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA207&dq=info:bDOW6_NpqbEJ:scholar.google.com&ots=lUVFHRjzoA&sig=6nMhWsM3ECzk2_tHJ2iYxbUpcjw', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 5, 'id_citations': 'n0WnuCwAAAAJ:zLWjf1WUPmwC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '12801879912127804268', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Chapters 3 and 5 have shown that heads of families reduce their labor supply in response to the experimental NIT treatments. Reductions in labor supply are generally considered to be an undesirable effect of an NIT, primarily because of the increased costs associated with such a decline and the corresponding reduc-tion in gross national product (GNP). However, reductions in labor supply can have desirable effects. For example, the reduction might take the form of increased production in the home (Gronau, 1977), which although not included in GNP is generally considered productive effort, or it might take the temporary form of a job change in order to improve the work environment. It is of considerable importance, therefore to study the nature of the labor supply response to an NIT as well as the characteristics of any changes in the work environment that may occur.</div><div class="gsh_csp">This chapter analyzes the effects of SIME/DIME on job satisfaction (or perceived job quality), using data from a job satisfaction survey given to family heads.

Spilerman and Miller analyze a sample of male family heads who change jobs. They find that an NIT increases the job satisfaction of younger males who were initially more educated and in better occupations while it decreases the job satisfaction of older, less educated males who were initially in lower level occupations.

The theoretical model relates program participation to experimentally induced changes in wage rates, nonwage income, and disposable income. The results indicate that participation in an NIT program increases with the NIT support level and decreases with the NIT tax rate. It is found that choice is an important determinant of participation in an NIT program. A model of labor supply with varying participation rates is specified and estimated.

The model is a framework for cross-section estimation of the effects of child care costs on labor supply and child care use.  It applies to households having young children requiring continuous care and in which both the mother and 1 other potential child care provider are present.  The 3 potential sources of child care are the mother the potential informal provider and the market.  Using data from the 1980 baseline household survey of the Employment Opportunity Pilot Projects this empirical analysis uses a subsample of 6170 households in which there is a married woman under age 45 with her spouse present at the time of the survey at least 1 child under age 14 and nonmissing data on key variables.  Results show that 1) higher market child care costs discourage women from working even when an informal source of care is available indicating that such informal care is an imperfect substitute for market care; 2) a higher wage rate for the mother encourages her to work thus a higher wage rate increases the probability of using market child care; 3) the number of children requiring care has a negative impact on the probability of the women working with the largest impact caused by younger children; 4) nonwage income has a negative impact on the probability of the woman working; and 5) black women are more likely to work than whites and are statistically more likely than whites to use market child care if they do work.

This paper summarizes the effects of some of these changes, and then uses microsimulation analysis to estimate the likely effects of a variation on the Child Support Assurance System (CSAS) proposed by Garfinkel and Melli as an alternative to the child support system currently used. Based on the philosophy that all parents are obligated to share their income with their children, the CSAS calls for a uniform percentage standard to establish the amount of child support awards, an immediate withholding of child support payments from the income of noncustodial parents, and an assured child support benefit paid to all eligible families. The authors find that by implementing the CSAS, much more private child support could be collected and the incomes of poor custodial parents could increase considerably. As a result, there would be a decrease in the number of custodial-parent families in poverty and in welfare use. Achieving this reduction in poverty and welfare use, however, is not estimated to cost a great deal and may not increase dependency on public transfers.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Daniel R Meyer and Irwin Garfinkel and Philip K Robins and Donald Oellerich', 'eprint': 'http://www.irp.wisc.edu/publications/dps/pdfs/dp94091.pdf', 'title': 'Institute for Research on Poverty', 'url': 'http://www.irp.wisc.edu/publications/dps/pdfs/dp94091.pdf', 'year': 1991}, 'citedby': 2, 'id_citations': 'n0WnuCwAAAAJ:g3aElNc5_aQC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '7378346543469996919', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small">A sociologist used the focus group technique in Atlanta Georgia and Cleveland Ohio to understand the downward trend in the birth rate among US Jews by concentrating on the personal and subjective factors that influence family planning decision making.

In the 1 child families the wives had more weight in making the decision about childbearing than the husbands.  The opposite was true in the larger families.  The leading reason for having only 1 child was economics.  Another contributing factor included career objectives of the mother.  Further before marriage 1 child couples did not necessarily want to become parents.  As for the larger families both parents expressed strong parental drives.  Their primary motive for having large families was the desire to love and nurture their own children.

Discussions of welfare reform emphasize developing comprehensive childcare programs that can be integrated into a more general system of providing tax relief for low-and moderate-income families (Lewis, 1973; Krashinsky, 1973). As more women enter the labor force and take advantage of available subsidies, it is important that the effects of various programs on labor supply and childcare demand be fully understood. In this chapter, we examine the effects of an NIT on the demand for childcare and the labor supply of single mothers. The SIME/DIME experiments are expected to affect labor supply and use of childcare through two mechanisms. First is the direct and rather well-known work disincentive effect resulting from the high marginal tax rates and increased levels of nonwage income for families receiving NIT payments (see Keeley et al., 1978a, b, and Chapters 3 and 5 in this volume). In addition to the NIT component, SIME/DIME include a program for childcare subsidies similar to those available under the AFDC program. The principal difference between the SIME/DIME and AFDC programs is that SIME/DIME allow reimbursement of childcare expenses irrespective of family income level. In a study of working wives, Robins and Spiegelman (1978) found that subsidization of certain forms of childcare led to increased use of those types of care. Similar results were obtained for single female heads in the SIME/DIME sample (Kurz et al., 1975). The availability of childcare subsidies raises net wage rates of users of subsidized modes of care.

While there is strong evidence that such programs can increase overall employment, the crucial question of how these increases arise is not well-understood. This paper presents a rigorous analysis of employment entry and exit effects, using a fully-specified dynamic model of employment duration that accounts for non-random sorting into employment statuses through flexible specifications for duration dependence and unobserved heterogeneity. The results indicate that for the Corpus Christi site, short-term effects were due to both employment retention and employment entry but, over time (as the program ceased operation), the retention effects faded out but the employment entry effects persisted and grew. For the Fort Worth site, there were smaller effects overall and less evidence of impacts that lasted much beyond the program operation period.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Richard Dorsett and Richard Hendra and Philip K Robins and Sonya Williams', 'eprint': 'https://www.niesr.ac.uk/sites/default/files/publications/dp409_0.pdf', 'title': 'NIESR Discussion Paper No. 409', 'url': 'https://www.niesr.ac.uk/sites/default/files/publications/dp409_0.pdf', 'year': 2013}, 'id_citations': 'n0WnuCwAAAAJ:NJ774b8OgUMC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">This paper uses data from the age 33 wave of the British National Child Development Survey (NCDS) to analyze the effects of a parental disruption (divorce or death of a father) on the labour market performance of children when they reach adulthood.

SSP is generally considered to have been one of the most successful pilot programs ever evaluated through social experimentation. The cost–benefit analysis of SSP indicated that the program resulted in a substantial net gain to society. However, the cost–benefit analysis did not take into account the program’s effects on participants’ non-market time. The purpose of this paper is to examine whether the conclusions reached from the cost–benefit analysis of SSP would be altered if the program’s effects on the non-market time of participants were taken into account. Using conservative assumptions about a number of key parameters underlying the labour supply schedule, the results indicate that the net social benefits from SSP are greatly reduced once lost non-market time is taken into account. When sensitivity tests are conducted using less conservative assumptions, the estimate of SSP’s net social benefits is even further reduced, even turning negative under certain assumptions. It is important to keep in mind that this study examines only one possible limitation of the original SSP cost–benefit study. Other considerations are mentioned that could act to increase the net gains from SSP.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'David H Greenberg and Philip K Robins', 'eprint': 'http://www.srdc.org/uploads/greenberg_robins-2006.pdf', 'publisher': 'Social Research and Demonstration Corporation', 'title': 'The Value of Non-market Time Lost During the Self-Sufficiency Project', 'url': 'http://www.srdc.org/uploads/greenberg_robins-2006.pdf', 'year': 2006}, 'id_citations': 'n0WnuCwAAAAJ:5Ul4iDaHHb8C', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">This research tests the proposition that convenience of child care is an important factor influencing economic decisions of low-income families with young children.

Both Blinder and Yellen and other authors (in particular, Stephen Nickell and Lisa Lynch) emphasize falling computer prices and fast productivity growth in the IT sector as contributors to productivity growth elsewhere. Of course, the fact that these technologies were available to European countries, which did not mirror the experience of the United States, needs explanation. Giuseppe Bertola, Francine Blau, and Lawrence Kahn argue that although more strict European regulation may explain some of the difference, the much better US performance in the late 1990s remains a puzzle. A possible reason is the change in work practices in the United States, emphasized by Jessica Cohen, William Dickens, and Adam Posen as a key reason for the fall in the US NAIRU, which to my knowledge (though this is not discussed in the book) did not take place in Europe. Reforms in work practices increased flexibility within the corporation, increased product market competition, and dissipated the rents for high-wage jobs.

Four basic principles of an ideal child care system are outlined, and a general two-tiered system of support is proposed that would satisfy these four principles. The two-tiered system is centered on a refundable tax credit considerably more progressive than the current child care tax credit.

The simulation incorporates a model of the labor supply decision representing the custodial parent\'s choice of whether to participate in CSAS or in the current AFDC system. The results suggest that CSAS can significantly reduce poverty as well as welfare caseloads.

Consequently, a number of bills containing provisions to subsidize child care have been introduced into Congress. As a first step in considering possible behavioral responses to proposed child care subsidies, this paper presents estimates of a structural model in which a mother simultaneously chooses her labor status, whether or not to purchase market child care, and the quality of care purchased. The authors find that among mothers who work and purchase child care, an increase in wages does not result in a proportional increase in child care expenditures, and that a mother will not change the number of hours she works at her job, regardless of any child care subsidies or an increase in wages. Estimation results are also used to simulate the effects of two proposed changes in the federal child care tax credit. The simulation results indicate that the primary effect of a more generous credit is to allow working mothers who use free care to purchase higher quality market care.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Philip K Robins', 'eprint': 'https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fd9c/4c4b89c78dce8cfc8ebfad9315306e39fe08.pdf', 'title': 'Institute for Research on Poverty', 'url': 'https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fd9c/4c4b89c78dce8cfc8ebfad9315306e39fe08.pdf', 'year': 1987}, 'id_citations': 'n0WnuCwAAAAJ:Tiz5es2fbqcC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'author': 'Philip K Robins', 'number': '3', 'pages': '1242-1243', 'publisher': 'AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC', 'title': 'EXPERIMENTAL SOCIAL PROGRAMS AND ANALYTIC METHODS-AN EVALUATION OF THE UNITED-STATES INCOME-MAINTENANCE PROJECTS-BASILEVSKY, A, HUM, D', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9797742013932479146&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'volume': '24', 'year': 1986}, 'id_citations': 'n0WnuCwAAAAJ:fQNAKQ3IYiAC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Over the past twenty years there has been a substantial increase in the number of families headed by single parents, due to both a rise in the divorce rate and a rise in the proportion of illegitimate births."

The parameters of this model are introduced into a microsimulation model called Microanalysis of Transfers to Households (MATH). The simulations employ the March 1975 Current Population Survey (CPS), which is a weighted random sample of the US population.

The goal of SSP is to see whether this form of incentive is an effective way of putting more money into the hands of poor families and, at the same time, of encouraging work as a way to achieve greater economic self-sufficiency.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Charles Michalopoulos and David Card and Lisa A Gennetian and Kristen Harknett and Philip K Robins', 'eprint': 'http://www.srdc.org/uploads/EngSSPAdultOutcomes.pdf', 'title': 'The Self-Sufficiency Project at 36 Months: Effects of', 'url': 'http://www.srdc.org/uploads/EngSSPAdultOutcomes.pdf'}, 'id_citations': 'n0WnuCwAAAAJ:BrmTIyaxlBUC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Ce rapport est le dernier d\'une série portant sur le Projet d\'autosuffisance (PAS), qui a été réalisé pour mettre à l\'essai une stratégie visant à «rendre le travail payant», de façon à encourager les assistées sociales de longue date à trouver un emploi.
