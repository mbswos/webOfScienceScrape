In this context, a large class of possibly complex sequences of signals can be supported as the separating equilibrium actions of the “strong type” of the informed player. I characterize the set of such sequences. I also characterize the sequences of signals in least cost separating equilibria (LCSE) of these games. In doing this, I introduce a state variable that can be interpreted as a measure of reputation. This gives the optimization problem characterizing the LCSE a recursive structure. I show that, in general, the equilibrium path sequences of signals have a simple structure. The shapes of the optimal sequences depend critically on the relative concavities of the payoff functions of different types, which measure the relative preferences towards payoff smoothing.</div></div></div></div></div>', 'author': 'Ayça Kaya', 'eprint': 'https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/6559705.pdf', 'journal': 'Games and Economic Behavior', 'number': '2', 'pages': '841-854', 'publisher': 'Academic Press', 'title': 'Repeated signaling games', 'url': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899825608001723', 'volume': '66', 'year': 2009}, 'citedby': 64, 'id_citations': 'pp_DXsgAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C', 'id_scholarcitedby': '17270276830172862523', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"> <div class="gsh_csp">We present a dynamic model of trading under adverse selection in which a seller sequentially meets buyers, each of whom receives a noisy signal about the quality of the seller’s asset and offers a price. We fully characterize the equilibrium trading dynamics and show that buyers’ beliefs about the quality of the asset can either increase or decrease over time, depending on the initial level. This result demonstrates how the introduction of private buyer signals enriches the set of trading patterns that can be accommodated within the framework of dynamic adverse selection, thereby broadening its applicability.

Under natural assumptions on type distributions and for any discount factor, we show that the unobservability of past negotiations leads to lower prices and faster trading. Unobservability, therefore, enhances the “Coasian effect” by fostering efficiency and diverting more of the surplus to the player who possesses private information. In addition, we show that the equilibrium is unique and is in pure strategies in the nontransparent regime; this stands in sharp contrast to the existing literature and allows for a better understanding of the Coasian effect and price observability.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Ayca Kaya and Qingmin Liu', 'eprint': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.3982/TE1566', 'journal': 'Theoretical Economics', 'number': '2', 'pages': '341-383', 'publisher': 'Blackwell Publishing Ltd', 'title': 'Transparency and price formation', 'url': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3982/TE1566', 'volume': '10', 'year': 2015}, 'citedby': 25, 'id_citations': 'pp_DXsgAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '5395250001146305015', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"> <div class="gsh_csp">Team production takes advantage of technological complementarities but comes with the cost of free-ridership. When workers differ in skills, the choice of sorting pattern may be associated with a nontrivial trade-off between exploiting the technological complementarities and minimizing the cost of free-ridership. This paper demonstrates that whether such a trade-off arises depends (i) on how the power of incentives required for effort provision varies with workers’ types, and (ii) on whether the workers are organized for production in partnerships or in corporations. These results have implications for how production is organized in different industries—in partnerships or in corporations.

Which of these is the case depends on both the details of the technology and the contractual environment. In the former case, the presence of moral hazard moves the market away from positive sorting. In the latter case, whether moral hazard favors positive or negative sorting depends on how the power of incentives needed to implement effort varies with the observable types of the agents.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Ayça Kaya and Galina Vereshchagina', 'eprint': 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00199-015-0895-6', 'journal': 'Economic Theory', 'number': '1', 'pages': '73-121', 'publisher': 'Springer Berlin Heidelberg', 'title': 'Moral hazard and sorting in a market for partnerships', 'url': 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00199-015-0895-6', 'volume': '60', 'year': 2015}, 'citedby': 14, 'id_citations': 'pp_DXsgAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '17076387854924571610', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">A Walrasian market for contracts with two-sided private information is considered.

When there is two-sided private information and contracts are restricted to be budget balancing, positively sloped matchings cannot be equilibrium outcomes. When money burning to break the budget balance is possible, positively sloped matchings can be equilibrium outcomes. However positive assortative matching (PAM) is not always an equilibrium outcome. Necessary and sufficient conditions are identified for PAM to occur in equilibrium. In particular, when the type distribution is close enough to a continuum, PAM is never an equilibrium outcome. Even when PAM is an equilibrium outcome it is not the unique one. This contrasts with the case with one-sided private information and the case of complete information where PAM is the unique equilibrium outcome.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Ayca Kaya', 'publisher': 'mimeo', 'title': 'Two-sided Matching with Private Information', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9397556344174553609&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 5, 'id_citations': 'pp_DXsgAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C', 'id_scholarcitedby': '9397556344174553609', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small">Solution concepts which implement only monotonic social choice rules are characterized in terms of a new notion of monotonicity pertaining to solution concepts.

Team members exaggerate their effort to influence the interim feedback signal, which in turn, affects their partners’ beliefs about the prospects and consequently affects their future effort choices. The free-riding problem can vanish in the limit where feedback is sufficiently responsive. Our result implies that introducing uncertainty into team production can be welfare improving.
