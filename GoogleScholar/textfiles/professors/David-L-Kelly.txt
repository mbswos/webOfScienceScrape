The control of climate change is a formidable challenge: no other environmental problem has so much uncertainty, requires so much coordination among countries, and is so dynamically linked across time. Climate change is so interesting because the problem encompasses all aspects of environmental science and economics. On the scientific side, significant uncertainties remain about the transport of the greenhouse gas (GHG) pollutants through the atmosphere and the effect of GHGs on the atmospheric temperature, ocean temperature, rainfall, and sea level. The study of such climate processes requires the use of large computer models called general circulation models (GCMs).</div><div class="gsh_csp">The economics of climate change is even less well-understood. Significant uncertainties remain about the impacts of climate change on industries such as agriculture and recreation (eg, skiing).

For example, innovations in the automobile industry such as more inexpensive electric cars could dramatically reduce the seriousness of the climate change problem. 1 Assigning weight to benefits received far in the future is quite difficult.

Previous work in partial equilibrium shows that subsidies to environmentally sensitive industries increases output and pollution emissions. We examine the environmental effects of subsidies in general equilibrium. Since all resources are used, whether or not subsidies increase emissions depends on the relative emissions intensity and incentives to emit of the subsidized industry versus the emissions intensity and the incentives to emit of the industry which would otherwise use the resources. Since subsidies must move resources to a less productive use, the economy wide marginal product of emissions falls with an increase in any subsidy, tending to decrease emissions. On the other hand, subsidies tend to move resources to more emissions intensive industries. Thus, subsidies increase pollution emissions if resources are moved to an industry for which emissions intensity is high enough to overcome the reduction in emissions caused by lower overall marginal product of emissions. We show that, under general conditions, subsidies also increase the interest rate, thus causing the economy to over-accumulate capital. Steady state emissions then rise, even if emissions fall in the short run. We also derive an optimal second best environmental policy given industrial subsidies.

The rapidity at which uncertainty in the climate sensitivity is resolved has significant policy implications. If resolution is expected soon, deferring action until the picture is clearer may be prudent. If uncertainty is likely to be resolved only slowly, then action today on the basis of expected costs and damages may be the wisest course. Here we use a Bayesian learning model, the instrumental temperature record, and IPCC scenarios of future emissions of greenhouse gases and SO2 to estimate the time required to reduce the uncertainty in the climate sensitivity. We find that more than half a century is required to be 95% confident that the true value of the climate sensitivity lies within±20% of the estimated value.

A calibration test of the model shows that the features of the market microstructure, without serially correlated news, accounts qualitatively for the serial correlation in the data, but predicts less persistence than is present …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'David L Kelly and Douglas G Steigerwald', 'eprint': 'https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt00n4h4mw/qt00n4h4mw.pdf', 'journal': 'Studies in Nonlinear Dynamics & Econometrics', 'number': '1', 'publisher': 'De Gruyter', 'title': 'Private information and high-frequency stochastic volatility', 'url': 'https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/snde.2004.8.1/snde.2004.8.1.1167/snde.2004.8.1.1167.xml', 'volume': '8', 'year': 2004}, 'citedby': 11, 'id_citations': 'JdL7Hw0AAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C', 'id_scholarcitedby': '16980185064056794519', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Government policies that are not intended to address environmental concerns can nonetheless distort prices and affect firms’ emissions. We present an analytical general equilibrium model to study the effect of distortionary subsidies on factor prices, pollution, and welfare. Based on real-world policies, we model an output subsidy, a capital subsidy, relief from environmental regulation, and a minimum level of labor employment that firms must agree to in exchange for the subsidies. Each policy creates both output effects and substitution effects on input prices and emissions. We calibrate the model to the Chinese economy. Variation in production substitution elasticities does not substantially affect input prices, but it does substantially affect emissions. Distortionary subsidies can both raise emissions and decrease output. Therefore, reducing distortionary subsidies can reduce emissions without a trade-off in lost output …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Garth Heutel and David L Kelly', 'eprint': 'http://sites.gsu.edu/gheutel/files/2016/05/HeutelKelly_JAERE-23otoxu.pdf', 'journal': 'Journal of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists', 'number': '2', 'pages': '361-415', 'publisher': 'University of Chicago Press', 'title': 'Incidence, Environmental, and Welfare Effects of Distortionary Subsidies', 'url': 'https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/684578', 'volume': '3', 'year': 2016}, 'citedby': 7, 'id_citations': 'JdL7Hw0AAAAJ:o-PowTg_VKEC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '8980609281163039753', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div><div><div class="gsh_csp">We perform two tests that estimate the mass of the upper tail of the distribution of aggregate US tropical cyclone damages.

We do this for four radiative forcing models (RFMs):(1) greenhouse gases alone (G),(2) G plus anthropogenic sulfate aerosol (GA),(3) GA plus tropospheric ozone and putative solar irradiance variations (GTAS), and (4) GTAS plus volcano radiative forcing (GTASV). We find that the estimates of∆ Tx2 by the ARM are systematically biased low compared to the estimates of∆ Tx2 by SCM, ranging from 24% for GTASV to 63% for G. Analysis of the ARM results show that they are equivalent to those given by the simplest climate/ocean model: an energybalance-climate/mixed-layer-ocean model, with mixed-layer depth h, vertically uniform temperature and no heat exchange with the deeper ocean. The ARM attempts to reproduce all the changes in the observed temperature record, both the rapidly varying changes and the slowly varying changes. To do so the ARM considerably reduces the heat capacity of the climate system such that h ranges from 38.7 m for GA to 185.7 m for GTASV. The corresponding efolding time for the results of the ARM range from 2.2 years for GTAS to 5.1 years for GTASV.

Therefore, addictive tax revenue falls prior to the tax increase.

Additionally, returns to some specialized crops that can only be grown in particular areas are very high relative to other agricultural products; this tends to obscure relationships for agriculture in general. We sought a compact, contiguous region with similarities in agriculture. We settled on the following criteria in selecting states: the majority of land is agricultural; the majority of agricultural land is cropland; and each state in the sample is contiguous to at least two other states in the sample.

After all, there has been no long run slow down in the growth of technology over the past few centuries, and the rate of population growth has actually been increasing for the past 19 centuries. Even if either of these growth rates were expected to slow, by how much is subject to great uncertainty. It is shown computationally that such continued growth greatly increases the severity of climate change. Climate change is a problem in large partcausedby exogenous population and technology growth. Rapid reductions in growth make climate change a small problem; smaller reductions in growth imply climate change is a very serious problem indeed. 13 refs., 5 figs., 3 tabs.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'DL Kelly and ChD Kolstad', 'journal': 'Energy and Economic Growth: Is Sustainable Growth Possible?.', 'pages': '52-65', 'title': 'The role of population growth in controlling greenhouse gas emissions', 'url': 'https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/620721', 'volume': '1', 'year': 1997}, 'id_citations': 'JdL7Hw0AAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">In recent years, scientists have become increasingly certain that the rise in global mean temperature is due in part to rising concentrations of greenhouse gasses (GHGs). Evidence has come from two directions, observation of the climate and greenhouse gas concentrations (detection of the climate change fingerprint) and from computational models which use physical relationships (GCMs). However, as has often been pointed out, such work does not account for the possibility that the recent warming trend could be part of the natural long run cycles in the climate (as evidenced by ice ages which last for thousands of years). Such cycles have a statistical analog in the presence of near-unit roots. We find that a unit root in the temperature series cannot be rejected, and the forcing from greenhouse gas concentrations is very similar to a time trend. Hence there is the possibility that the temperature rise is due to long run cycles, and that the relationship between temperature and GHGs is spurious. However, when we adjust the data to account for the possibility of unit roots, the relationship between temperature and GHGs remains, indicating that previous findings are robust.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'David L Kelly', 'eprint': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Kelly21/publication/251784556_Is_the_Recent_Warming_Due_to_Persistent_Shocks/links/00b7d52bc6021c5b9f000000.pdf', 'title': 'Unit Roots in the Climate', 'url': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Kelly21/publication/251784556_Is_the_Recent_Warming_Due_to_Persistent_Shocks/links/00b7d52bc6021c5b9f000000.pdf'}, 'id_citations': 'JdL7Hw0AAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC', 'source': 'citations'}]
