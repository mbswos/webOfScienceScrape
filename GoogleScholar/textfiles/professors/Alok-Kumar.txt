These findings complement existing studies on how weather impacts stock index returns and identify another channel through which it can manifest.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'William N Goetzmann and Dasol Kim and Alok Kumar and Qin Wang', 'eprint': 'https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/28/1/73/1682299', 'journal': 'The Review of Financial Studies', 'number': '1', 'pages': '73-111', 'publisher': 'Oxford University Press', 'title': 'Weather-induced mood, institutional investors, and stock returns', 'url': 'https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article-abstract/28/1/73/1682299', 'volume': '28', 'year': 2014}, 'citedby': 108, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '18416258155665450991', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div><div class="gsh_csp">Using a demographics-based proxy for smartness, we show that the portfolio distortions of “smart” investors reflect an informational advantage, while the distortions of “dumb” investors reflect psychological biases.

Combining the capacity of diverse nanocomposites to scavenge toxic species such as arsenic, lead, and other contaminants along with the above capability can result in affordable, all-inclusive drinking water purifiers that can function without electricity. The critical problem in achieving this is the synthesis of stable materials that can release silver ions continuously in the presence of complex species usually present in drinking water that deposit and cause scaling on nanomaterial surfaces. Here we show that such constant release materials can be synthesized in a simple and effective fashion in water itself without the use of electrical power.

First, we show that a vast majority of individual investors in our sample are under-diversified and the unexpectedly high idiosyncratic risk in their portfolios results in a welfare loss–the least diversified group of investors earn 2.40% lower return annually than the most diversified group of investors on a risk-adjusted basis. Next, we examine the determinants of investors’ under-diversification and find that younger, low-income, and relatively less sophisticated investors hold less diversified portfolios. In addition, investors who prefer skewness, exhibit relatively stronger familiarity bias, and exhibit greater over-confidence are less diversified. Finally, we show that the systematic under-diversification of individual investors influence asset prices. A zero-cost portfolio (DIV factor) that takes a long position in stocks with the least diversified individual investor clientele and a short position in stocks with the most diversified individual investor clientele earns an annual excess return of 7.44% on a risk-adjusted basis. Furthermore, this factor has power to explain the cross-sectional variation in returns for a considerable group of stocks.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'William N Goetzmann and Alok Kumar', 'eprint': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/William_Goetzmann/publication/23754620_Diversification_Decisions_of_Individual_Investors_and_Asset_Prices/links/00463523cb65e9adfa000000/Diversification-Decisions-of-Individual-Investors-and-Asset-Prices.pdf', 'journal': 'Yale School of Management Working Papers (Yale School of Management.)', 'title': 'Diversification decisions of individual investors and asset prices', 'url': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/William_Goetzmann/publication/23754620_Diversification_Decisions_of_Individual_Investors_and_Asset_Prices/links/00463523cb65e9adfa000000/Diversification-Decisions-of-Individual-Investors-and-Asset-Prices.pdf', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 51, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:eA5wQj470iYC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '3750319518142493069', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">This article reviews common reasons why multinational firms have given questionable payments to foreign officials, noting that unsavory business practices have been extremely difficult to change.

This confirmation bias would make them more overconfident and adversely affect their investment performance. An analysis of 502 investor responses from the largest message board operator in South Korea supports our conjecture. We find that investors exhibit confirmation bias when they process information from message boards. We also demonstrate that investors with stronger confirmation bias exhibit greater overconfidence. Those investors have higher expectations about their performance, trade more frequently, but obtain lower realized returns. Collectively, these results suggest that participation in virtual communities increases investors’ propensity to commit investment mistakes and is likely to be detrimental to their investment performance.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'JaeHong Park and Prabhudev Konana and Bin Gu and Alok Kumar and Rajagopal Raghunathan', 'eprint': 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.883.6056&rep=rep1&type=pdf', 'journal': 'McCombs Research Paper Series No. IROM-07-10', 'title': 'Confirmation bias, overconfidence, and investment performance: Evidence from stock message boards', 'url': 'https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1639470', 'year': 2010}, 'citedby': 42, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '15850811295170687964', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div><div><div class="gsh_csp">We examine whether the decision to participate in the stock market and other related portfolio decisions are influenced by income hedging motives.

We show that retail investors prefer to hold and actively trade high idiosyncratic volatility stocks due to their propensity to speculate and because those stocks offer greater opportunities for experiencing utility over realizing gains. We find that stocks with high proportion of retail trading tend to earn lower future returns, especially if they are speculative stocks and are more difficult to arbitrage.

Understanding the patterns of utilization of AYUSH care has been important for various reasons including an increased focus on its mainstreaming and integration with biomedicine-based health care system. Based on a nationally representative health survey 2014, we present an analysis to understand utilization of AYUSH care across socioeconomic and demographic groups in India. Overall, 6.9% of all patients seeking outpatient care in the reference period of last two weeks have used AYUSH services without any significant differentials across rural and urban India. Importantly, public health facilities play a key role in provisioning of AYUSH care in rural areas with higher utilization in Chhattisgarh, Kerala and West Bengal. Use of AYUSH among middle-income households is lower when compared with poorer and richer households. We also find that low-income households display a greater tendency for AYUSH self-medication. AYUSH care utilization is higher among patients with chronic diseases and also for treating skin-related and musculo-skeletal ailments. Although the overall share of AYUSH prescription drugs in total medical expenditure is only about 6% but the average expenditure for drugs on AYUSH and allopathy did not differ hugely.

In this study, we evaluated the potential of curcumin to reverse promoter methylation of the p15 gene in Raji cells and its ability to induce apoptosis and genomic instability. Anti-neoplastic action of curcumin showed an augmentation in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell cycle arrest in G1 phase. Subsequently, curcumin-exposed Raji cells showed structural abnormalities in chromosomes. These observations suggest that curcumin also causes ROS-mediated apoptosis and genomic instability. The treatment of Raji cell line with 10 μM curcumin caused hypomethylation of the p15 promoter after six days. Hypomethylation of p15 was further found to be favoured by downregulation of DNA methyltransferase 1 after 10 μM curcumin treatment for six days. Methylation-specific PCR suggested demethylation of the p15 promoter. Demethylation was further validated by DNA sequencing. Reverse-transcription PCR demonstrated that treatment with curcumin (10 μM) for six days led to the up-regulation of p15 and down-regulation of DNA methyltransferase 1. Furthermore, curcumin-mediated reversal of p15 promoter methylation might be potentiated by down-regulation of DNA methyltransferase 1 expression, which was supported by cell cycle analysis. Furthermore, curcumin acts as a double-pronged agent, as it caused apoptosis and promoter hypomethylation in Raji cells.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'V Sharma and AK Jha and A Kumar and A Bhatnagar and G Narayan and I Kaur', 'eprint': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vishal_Sharma8/publication/278021073_Curcumin-Mediated_Reversal_of_p15_Gene_Promoter_Methylation_Implication_in_Anti-Neoplastic_Action_against_Acute_Lymphoid_Leukaemia_Cell_Line_curcumin_apoptosis_DNA_cell/links/5579122a08aeb6d8c01f1db5/Curcumin-Mediated-Reversal-of-p15-Gene-Promoter-Methylation-Implication-in-Anti-Neoplastic-Action-against-Acute-Lymphoid-Leukaemia-Cell-Line-curcumin-apoptosis-DNA-cell.pdf', 'journal': 'Folia biologica', 'number': '2', 'pages': '81', 'publisher': 'Charles University in Prague, First Faculty of Medicine', 'title': 'Curcumin-mediated reversal of p15 gene promoter methylation: implication in anti-neoplastic action against acute lymphoid leukaemia cell line', 'url': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vishal_Sharma8/publication/278021073_Curcumin-Mediated_Reversal_of_p15_Gene_Promoter_Methylation_Implication_in_Anti-Neoplastic_Action_against_Acute_Lymphoid_Leukaemia_Cell_Line_curcumin_apoptosis_DNA_cell/links/5579122a08aeb6d8c01f1db5/Curcumin-Mediated-Reversal-of-p15-Gene-Promoter-Methylation-Implication-in-Anti-Neoplastic-Action-against-Acute-Lymphoid-Leukaemia-Cell-Line-curcumin-apoptosis-DNA-cell.pdf', 'volume': '61', 'year': 2015}, 'citedby': 15, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:zPkyA21Y468C', 'id_scholarcitedby': '12366179989252126435', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'author': 'Akhil Dubey and Vaishali Jain and Ashwani Kumar', 'journal': 'Int.

Maximum population of leafhopper was recorded during 28th and 32nd standard week in 2008 and 2009 respectively. Maximum mean incidence was recorded in H-1226 during both the years. Whitefly population remained below ET during 2008 while during 2009 it crossed ET in RCH 134 BG-II (6.00-6.23 adults/leaf). Mean maximum population was recorded in IT-905 Bt (during 2008) and RCH-134 BG-II (during 2009). Leafhopper and whitefly population was significantly positively correlated with temperature while negatively correlated with rainfall.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Deepika Kalkal and Roshan Lal and KK Dahiya and YP Bharti', 'eprint': 'http://www.agriwaysjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/journals/volume1.1/POPULATION%20DYNAMICS%20OF%20SUCKING%20PEST%20&%20ITS%20CORRELATION%20WITH%20ABIOTIC%20FACTORS.pdf', 'journal': 'Agriways', 'number': '1', 'pages': '23-29', 'title': 'Population dynamics of sucking pest & its correlation with abiotic factors', 'url': 'http://www.agriwaysjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/journals/volume1.1/POPULATION%20DYNAMICS%20OF%20SUCKING%20PEST%20&%20ITS%20CORRELATION%20WITH%20ABIOTIC%20FACTORS.pdf', 'volume': '1', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 14, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:Z610oKUqOA4C', 'id_scholarcitedby': '16811969196529119850', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div><div><div class="gsh_csp">Aluminium alloys have a wide range of application in many key industries like aerospace and defence.

In the present investigation, Al 1100 H14 aluminum alloy strips were joined by friction stir welding (FSW) process by single and double sided welding. Also the effect of direction of welding on tensile properties of the joints was investigated. Standard thickness (4 mm) aluminium pieces were joined by FSW under various traversing speeds and rotational speeds. The effects on mechanical properties like surface hardness and tensile strength of the welded region were studied.

The first is the concentration level of the hazardous gases such as CO, SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and particulate matter. The second hazardous event was classified as a miner removing the mining helmet off their head. An IR sensor was developed unsuccessfully but an off-the shelf IR sensor was then used to successfully determine when the helmet is on the miner\'s head.

The present study aimed at development and evaluation of double low quality lines (seed oil with &lt; 2% erucic acid and glucosinolate content &lt; 30 µmoles/gram defatted seed meal) in Indian mustard. A total of 11 double low lines were selected from among a pool of 1200 lines in F7 generation. Amongst the selected lines, 2 lines BPRQ-2-1-5 and BPRQ-2-2-11 were found to be highly promising in terms of oil quality and yield performance.

They highlight several parallels between dysregulated pornography consumption and other maladaptive behaviors, some of which are viewed as addictions. Although we believe these parallels are worthy of scientific inquiry, Hilton and Watts offered little, if any, convincing evidence to support their perspectives. Instead, excessive liberties and misleading interpretations of neuroscience research are used to assert that excessive pornography consumption causes brain damage.

We find that retail investor buying pressure surges for ranked stocks. Subsequently, these stocks underperform unranked stocks by 1.72%(1.60%) during the next month on an equally-weighted (value-weighted) basis. To show causality, we introduce a new return-convention based identification strategy. For unranked stocks, the idiosyncratic volatility puzzle and related anomalies (maximum daily returns, expected idiosyncratic skewness) disappear.

It increases emission of nitrous oxide, which contributes 6.2%, while carbon dioxide and methane contribute 76% and 16%, respectively of the global warming. However, N causes cooling due to emission of NO x, which alters concentrations of tropospheric ozone and methane. NO x and NH 3 also form aerosols with considerable cooling effects. We studied global temperature change potential (GTP) of N use in agriculture. The GTP due to N 2 O was 396.67 and 1168.32 Tg CO 2 e on a 20-year (GTP 20) and 439.94 and 1295.78 Tg CO 2 e on 100-year scale (GTP 100) during years 1961 and 2010, respectively.

Early prediction of a Malaria outbreak is the key for control of malaria morbidity, mortality as well as reducing the risk of transmission of malaria in the community and can help policymakers, health providers, medical officers, ministry of health and other health organizations to better target medical resources to areas of greatest need. Here developed model “Malaria outbreak prediction Model using Machine Learning” can help as an early warning tool to identify potential outbreaks of Malaria. In this study two popular data mining classification algorithms Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) are used for Malaria prediction using a large dataset of Maharashtra state. Data of all 35 districts of Maharashtra, from 2011 to 2014 has been considered. Parameters used are Average monthly rainfall, Temperature, Humidity, Total number of positive cases, Total number of Plasmodium Falciparum (pF) cases and outbreak occur in binary values Yes or No. A large numbers of samples were collected from different sources. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) are used to measure the performance of the models. It is observed that performance of the model developed using SVM is more accurate than ANN. The SVM model can predict the outbreak 15-20 days in advance. However accuracy of prediction can be increased using more training data. This model can be scaled-up at country level.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Vijeta Sharma and Ajai Kumar and Dr Lakshmi Panat and Ganesh Karajkhede', 'eprint': 'https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2ce3/631949498f6f40cf3b9ab4096c082f1d0047.pdf', 'journal': 'International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Engineering & Technology (IJARCET)', 'number': '12', 'title': 'Malaria outbreak prediction model using machine learning', 'url': 'https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2ce3/631949498f6f40cf3b9ab4096c082f1d0047.pdf', 'volume': '4', 'year': 2015}, 'citedby': 10, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:edDO8Oi4QzsC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '28591783959110693', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small">The present investigation comprised of 7 lines of wheat and their 21 crosses in half diallel fashion with the objective to study the combining ability analysis, genetic variability parameters and heterosis for yield and its contributing traits.

Extremely and moderately halophilic bacteria dominate in saline environments (0.5% to saturated NaCl). Moderately halophilic microorganisms include a broad variety of bacteria and fungi that are able to grow in media containing a wide range of elevated NaCl concentrations (3-15% NaCl). Considerable attention has been focused on enzymes of moderately halophilic bacteria, since they have substantial biotechnological potential. While several proteases from extreme halophiles, members of the haloarchaea have been characterized, fewer proteases from moderately halophilic bacteria have been purified and studied in depth. These microorganisms use different strategies for preserving their cell structure and function in highly saline conditions. They may produce compounds of industrial interest, such as extracellular hydrolytic enzymes with diverse potential applications in the industries. Therefore, an attempt is done in the present study for isolation of moderately halophilic bacteria and fungi able to produce protease which is of industrial importance.

Using data from several European countries as well as the US, we show that taller individuals are smarter, healthier, more optimistic, and socially more active.

Using firm-level sentiment data, we first demonstrate that managers located closer to these negative events become more pessimistic. Then, we show that local managers temporarily reduce R&amp;D expenditure and long-term leverage and increase cash holdings around the periods of terrorist attacks. The impact of negative events on corporate policies becomes weaker as the firm-event distance increases. Further, events with greater media coverage induce larger shifts in corporate policies and the impact is more pronounced among firms with younger CEOs.

Some of these techniques are computationally less complex but fails to provide sufficient security, and some techniques are though highly secured but increases computational overhead for encryption and decryption. This paper presents an efficient bit-plane encryption algorithm using chaotic, quadratic, and cubic maps.

A majority of injuries present as aneurysms following penetrating trauma, fracture pelvis or posterior dislocation of the hip joint. We reported a rare case of superior gluteal artery pseudoaneurysm following blunt trauma presenting as large expanding right gluteal hematoma without any bony injury. The gluteal hematoma was suspected clinically, confirmed by ultrasound and the arterial injury was diagnosed by CT angiography that revealed a large right gluteal hematoma with a focal contrast leakage forming a pseudoaneurysm within the hematoma. Pseudoaneurysm arose from the superior gluteal branch of right internal iliac artery, which was successfully angioembolized.

However, at high substrate concentrations, the dimensionless variance of the turnover time distribution shows systematic deviations from the Michaelis–Menten prediction. This difference is attributed to conformational fluctuations in both the enzyme and the enzyme–substrate complex and to the possibility of both parallel- and off-pathway kinetics. Here, we use the chemical master equation to model the kinetics of a single fluctuating enzyme that can yield a product through either parallel- or off-pathway mechanisms. An exact expression is obtained for the turnover time distribution from which the mean turnover time and randomness parameters are calculated.

The results show that feed is the principal cutting parameter influencing Ra, followed by cutting speed. The machined surface characterisation has been investigated in this study, along with optimisation and development of mathematical model for Ra. Additionally, the effect of tool wear on Ra has been studied. The experimental data were further analysed to predict the optimal range of Ra. Finally, based on response surface methodology (RSM) a mathematical model is developed for Ra with 95% confidence level.

The study revealed that the locals are knowledgeable of about 38 medicinal plants used for curing 24 different human ailments. However, the practice of utilising medicinal plants in their local healthcare system is sharply declining due to lack of education facility; that has lead to lack of knowledge as well as transfer of knowledge to youger generations. The richness of knowledge about medicinal plants was assessed using Knowledge Richness Index among different age groups.

Using trade clustering as a proxy for narrow framing, we find that investors who are more likely to adopt a narrow decision frame exhibit higher disposition effect and hold less diversified portfolios.

The emergence of antibiotic-resistant Campylobacter spp. necessitates the development of new antimicrobials. We identified novel anti-Campylobacter small molecule inhibitors using a high throughput growth inhibition assay. To expedite screening, we made use of a “bioactive” library of 4,182 compounds that we have previously shown to be active against diverse microbes. Screening for growth inhibition of Campylobacter jejuni, identified 781 compounds that were either bactericidal or bacteriostatic at a concentration of 200 µM. Seventy nine of the bactericidal compounds were prioritized for secondary screening based on their physico-chemical properties. Based on the minimum inhibitory concentration against a diverse range of C. jejuni and a lack of effect on gut microbes, we selected 12 compounds. No resistance was observed to any of these 12 lead compounds when C. jejuni was cultured with lethal or sub-lethal concentrations suggesting that C. jejuni is less likely to develop resistance to these compounds. Top 12 compounds also possessed low cytotoxicity to human intestinal epithelial cells (Caco-2 cells) and no hemolytic activity against sheep red blood cells. Next, these 12 compounds were evaluated for ability to clear C. jejuni in vitro. A total of 10 compounds had an anti-C. jejuni effect in Caco-2 cells with some effective even at 25 µM concentrations. These novel 12 compounds belong to five established antimicrobial chemical classes; piperazines, aryl amines, piperidines, sulfonamide and pyridazinone.

Tandem mono/tri/hexanucleotide repeats in the coding regions contribute to single amino acids repeats (SAARs) in the proteome. While SSRs in the coding region always result in amino acid repeats, a majority of SAARs arise due to a combination of various codons representing the same amino acid and not as a consequence of SSR events. Certain amino acids are abundant in repeat regions indicating a positive selection pressure behind the accumulation of SAARs. By analysing 22 proteomes including the human proteome, we explored the functional and structural relationship of amino acid repeats in an evolutionary context. Only ~15% of repeats are present in any known functional domain, while ~74% of repeats are present in the disordered regions, suggesting that SAARs add to the functionality of proteins by providing flexibility, stability and act as linker elements between domains. Comparison of SAAR containing proteins across species reveals that while shorter repeats are conserved among orthologs, proteins with longer repeats, &gt;15 amino acids, are unique to the respective organism. Lysine repeats are well conserved among orthologs with respect to their length and number of occurrences in a protein. Other amino acids such as glutamic acid, proline, serine and alanine repeats are generally conserved among the orthologs with varying repeat lengths. These findings suggest that SAARs have accumulated in the proteome under positive selection pressure and that they provide flexibility for optimal …</div></div>', 'author': 'Amitha Sampath Kumar and Divya Tej Sowpati and Rakesh K Mishra', 'eprint': 'https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0166854', 'journal': 'PloS one', 'number': '11', 'pages': 'e0166854', 'publisher': 'Public Library of Science', 'title': 'Single amino acid repeats in the proteome world: structural, functional, and evolutionary insights', 'url': 'https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0166854', 'volume': '11', 'year': 2016}, 'citedby': 7, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:rv71eUSj1K8C', 'id_scholarcitedby': '3869463419143543689', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">After the upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), which is foreseen in 2022, the radiation damage the tracking detectors will experience increases significantly.

However, after extracting the set of frames we implemented several classification techniques Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with several distance based classifiers and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) respectively with some variants for classify our all different gesture models. However, we conclude that use very less number of frame (10-15%) for train our system efficiently from the entire set of gesture frames. Moreover, after successfully completion of our classification methods we clinch an excellent overall accuracy 94%, 96% and 98% respectively.

A library of 4,182 compounds known to be bioactive against Saccharomyces cerevisiae was selected for primary screening against Cmm wild-type strain C290 for whole-cell growth inhibition. Four hundred sixty-eight molecules (11.2% hit rate) were identified as bacteriocidal or bacteriostatic against Cmm at 200 \uf06dM. Seventy-seven candidates were selected based on Golden Triangle analyses for secondary screening. Secondary screens showed that several of these candidates were strain-selective. Several compounds were inhibitory to multiple Cmm strains as well as Bacillus subtilis, but not Pseudomonas fluorescens, Mitsuaria sp., Lysobacter enzymogenes, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacter animalis, or Escherichia coli.

In the current situation, one of the promising and novel therapeutic agents could be the nanoparticles. In this study, antimicrobial susceptibility testing of CdS nanoparticles (pure and 1% Cu doped) was done against bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The antimicrobial activity of the nanoparticles was assessed by well diffusion method. The tested concentration range of CdS nanoparticles was 1mg/ml to 100mg/ml and activity was determined by measuring the zone of inhibition. After the preliminary antimicrobial qualitative test, the MIC and MBC was determined. Cu doped CdS nanoparticles were more effective with MIC range 0.078-0.52 mg/ml. as compared to pure CdS nanoparticles with range 0.15-0.83 mg/ml. The highest activity was observed against Staphylococcus aureus with MIC 0.078 mg/ml. and E. coli was least susceptible with MIC 0.83 mg/ml. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) study was also used to determine the effect of the nanoparticles on morphological changes of test microorganism.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Ashwani Kumar and Sunity Singh and Dinesh Kumar', 'eprint': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dinesh_Kumar9/publication/260203040_Evaluation_of_antimicrobial_potential_of_cadmium_sulphide_nanoparticles_against_bacterial_pathogens/links/0f317530233d8df3eb000000/Evaluation-of-antimicrobial-potential-of-cadmium-sulphide-nanoparticles-against-bacterial-pathogens.pdf', 'journal': 'International Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences Review and Research 2014, 24 (2): 202', 'title': 'Evaluation of antimicrobial potential of cadmium sulphide nanoparticles against bacterial pathogens', 'url': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dinesh_Kumar9/publication/260203040_Evaluation_of_antimicrobial_potential_of_cadmium_sulphide_nanoparticles_against_bacterial_pathogens/links/0f317530233d8df3eb000000/Evaluation-of-antimicrobial-potential-of-cadmium-sulphide-nanoparticles-against-bacterial-pathogens.pdf', 'volume': '206', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 7, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:xUT3DyvLuJwC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '15171942134800770994', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Communication is a meaningful exchange of information between two or more entities.

Our main conjecture is that as financial regulation makes the information environment more competitive, the local informational advantage of institutional investors would decline and their preference for local stocks would weaken. Consistent with this conjecture, we find that following regulatory changes there is a sharp decline in the ability of local investors to generate abnormal returns from their local investments. Concurrently, the excess local holdings of institutional investors decline by a half and ownership becomes more diffused geographically. This decline in local ownership and geographical concentration is more salient among firms that had more opaque information environments prior to the regulatory changes.

After relatively sunnier periods, managers have more optimistic expectations, and the component of their expectations related to mood influences hiring and investment decisions. Consequently, mood affects state-level job creation and new business starts, especially during periods of greater economic uncertainty.

For single Mn-doped NW, partially filled <i>d</i> orbital of Mn atom results in magnetic semiconducting behavior due to non-degenerate electronic band-gap (∼0.1 eV). We have further considered the effect of Mn–Mn coupling on the electronic/magnetic properties of InP NW.

Rising labor costs for manual transplanting of rice, concerns about depleting underground water, and increasing costs of irrigation have made transplanting less appealing to farmers. DSR is an alternative method that could reduce the labor and irrigation water requirements for crop establishment. During CSISA Phase I, the project conducted numerous training activities for farmers and service providers. To evaluate the CSISA training and identify constraints to farmers in adopting DSR, we conducted a survey of farmers who have used DSR in the 4-year period of 2009 to 2012 and conducted a study on their continuous use of DSR in eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Some of the sample farmers evaluated DSR in their own fields, often with project support, and documented what happened in subsequent years as they gained more experience with the technology.</div><div class="gsh_csp">To identify sample farmers, we obtained the list of farmers who participated in DSR training conducted by CSISA from 2009 to 2012 and farmers who received DSR services from CSISA-assisted service providers in the same period.

Our main conjecture is that the lottery-like features of GC stocks attract a predominantly retail clientele who use those stocks to gamble in the market. Such trading behavior leads to the underreaction to the GC event and significant downward drift in prices over the following year. Using a sample of first time GC firms from 1993 to 2007 we show that GC stocks have extreme lottery-type characteristics. We further demonstrate that retail investors have a proclivity to be net-buyers of these stocks around the GC event, and such contrarian behavior is directly related to the lottery-like nature of GC firms. Using individual investor-level trading, socioeconomic, and demographic data we confirm that retail investors who are known to have a greater propensity to gamble are more likely to trade GC stocks. We rule out several alternative explanations for our findings, and conclude that gambling-motivated trading behavior of retail investors is the most likely driver of the anomalous short-term market reaction and the associated longer-term market response following the release of going-concern audit opinion.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Asad Kausar and Alok Kumar and Richard Taffler', 'journal': 'Available at SSRN 2249029', 'title': 'Why the going-concern anomaly: gambling in the market?', 'url': 'https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2249029', 'year': 2013}, 'citedby': 6, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:RGFaLdJalmkC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '15743873178421011026', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">The accelerated growth of Sino-Turkish relations indicates their increasing convergence on foreign, economic and security policies, despite several constraints.

Newsletters change their asset mix between equity and cash using relatively simple rules that are strongly influenced by past market returns while macro-economic variables have only a very weak influence on their asset allocation decisions. On aggregate, newsletters do not outperform a passive investment strategy but there exist well-defined newsletter sub-groups (active newsletters, contrarian newsletters) that exhibit market-timing ability. Furthermore, when we examine the recommendations of individual newsletters at a higher frequency (daily as opposed to monthly), we find considerable evidence of timingability. There is also evidence of persistence in newsletters’ performance and a trading strategy that follows the average recommendations of newsletters that have performed well in the past 10 months is capable of outperforming the market on a risk-adjusted basis (the annual over-performance is 2.56%).</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Alok Kumar and Vicente Pons', 'eprint': 'http://www.finance.martinsewell.com/newsletters/KumarPons2002.pdf', 'journal': 'European Finance Association Annual Meeting, Berlin, materiały konferencyjne', 'title': 'Behavior and performance of investment newsletter analysts', 'url': 'http://www.finance.martinsewell.com/newsletters/KumarPons2002.pdf', 'year': 2002}, 'citedby': 6, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '752311771003287483', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'author': 'A Kumar and H Singh and D Kumar and M Singh and RV Singh', 'journal': 'Indian veterinary journal', 'number': '4', 'pages': '356-357', 'publisher': 'Indian Veterinary Association', 'title': 'STUDIES ON LACTATION CURVE IN HOLSTEIN FRIESIAN: SAHIWAL CROSSBRED COWS', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6284415427376524105&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'volume': '74', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 6, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:CC3C2HR4nz8C', 'id_scholarcitedby': '6284415427376524105', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'author': 'A Kumar and M Srivastava', 'journal': 'Indian Journal of Plant Physiology', 'title': 'Survey of local rhizobial isolates for their efficiency in nitrogen fixation and biomass production in Vigna mungo (L.)

Many methods have been tried to improve postoperative comfort after surgery. Ketamine is a phencyclidine derivative that induces a state of dissociative anesthesia. It is a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist and has a distinct suppression effect on central nervous system (CNS) sensitization. Ketamine in a subanesthetic dose is set to produce analgesic and anti-inflammatory effect. Sixty patients, between the age group of 18 and 38 years, undergoing the extraction of impacted mandibular third molar, reporting to the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery were included in the study. Patients were divided randomly into two groups: local anesthetic alone (LAA) and local anesthetic and ketamine (LAK). Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney U/unpaired--t-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test. There was a significant difference in mouth opening in the LAA and LAK group in the immediate postoperative period. There was a significant difference between the two groups after 1 hour (LAA: 2.37; LAK: 1.40), and 4 hours (LAA: 2.37; LAK: 1.40). There was a significant difference in terms of facial swelling in the immediate postoperative period and day 1 between the LAA and LAK group. Use of subanesthetic dose of ketamine is not only safe but also valuable in reducing patient morbidity after third molar surgery. Combination of a local anesthetic and subanesthetic dose of ketamine during surgical extraction of third molars provides good postoperative analgesia with less swelling and significantly less trismus.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'A Kumar and TP Kale', 'journal': 'The journal of contemporary dental practice', 'number': '12', 'pages': '957-962', 'title': 'A Comparative Study between the Effect of Combined Local Anesthetic and Low-dose Ketamine with Local Anesthetic on Postoperative Complications after Impacted Third Molar Surgery.', 'url': 'https://europepmc.org/abstract/med/27018030', 'volume': '16', 'year': 2015}, 'citedby': 5, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:rQKKVauEoioC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '6158182080136664369', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">This paper shows that changes in gambling attitudes affect asset prices and corporate decisions.

While both males and females are capable of strong social ties, the evolutionary drivers for sociality and the benefits accrued maybe different for each sex. In this study, we investigate the differential reproductive success benefits of group membership that males and females might obtain in the promiscuous fruit bat Cynopterus sphinx. Individuals of this species live in flexible social groups called colonies. These colonies are labile and there is high turnover of individuals. However, colony males sire more offspring within the colony suggesting that being part of a colony may result in reproductive benefits for males. This also raises the possibility that long-term loyalty towards the colony may confer additional advantage in terms of higher reproductive success. We used ten seasons of genetic parentage data to estimate reproductive success and relatedness of individuals in the colony. We used recapture data to identify long and short-term residents in the colony as well as to obtain rates of recapture for males and females. Our results reveal that males have a significantly higher chance of becoming long-term residents (than females), and these long-term resident males gain twice the reproductive success compared to short-term resident males.

The main concern of this study is to analyze the results and compare them under standard test conditions. PV systems are generally integrated with specific control algorithms in order to extract the maximum possible power. Hence it is highly imperative that the Maximum Power Point (MPP) is achieved effectively and thus we need to design a model from which the MPPT algorithm can be realized in an efficient way. Also other parameters should be taken into account for finding the best model for the use in simulation. It is very important to choose the appropriate model based on the application. The models used for study in this paper include the single diode model, two diode model and Simscape modelling. MATLAB/Simulink presents a powerful tool to study such systems. The work tests the accuracy of the models under different temperature and irradiance conditions. The two diode model is known to have better accuracy at low irradiance levels which allows for a more accurate prediction of PV system performance. Simscape, part of Simulink environment, has a solar cell block that makes building a PV model straightforward and much easier programming with full demonstration to all system details. On the basis of the study, the best model that can be used for simulation purposes can be selected. It is envisaged that the work can be very useful for professionals who require simple and accurate PV simulators for their design. All the systems here are modeled and simulated in MATLAB/Simulink environment.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'B Sai Pranahita and A Sai Kumar and A Pradyush Babu', 'eprint': 'http://www.academia.edu/download/41709412/A_STUDY_ON_MODELLING_AND_SIMULATION_OF_PHOTOVOLTAIC_CELLS.pdf', 'journal': 'International Journal of Research in Engineering and Technology', 'pages': '250-262', 'title': 'A Study on Modelling and Simulation of Photovoltaic Cells', 'url': 'http://www.academia.edu/download/41709412/A_STUDY_ON_MODELLING_AND_SIMULATION_OF_PHOTOVOLTAIC_CELLS.pdf', 'volume': '10', 'year': 2014}, 'citedby': 5, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:TNEldfgDb5MC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '10612222635912729402', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Cancer is a very complex genetic disorder that is mainly caused by carcinogens.

In the study of blood cancer that is leukemia, blood disorders through visual inspection of microscopic images of blood cells is a important diagnostic tool. From the identification of blood disorders, it can lead to classification of certain diseases related to blood. Doxorubicin drug most useful for cancer treatment such as Breast cancer, ovarian cancer, Lung cancer, Neuroblastoma cancer, Leukemia etc. In breast cancer efficacy of drug treatment will thus depend on the histology of the tumor tissue. In ovarian cancer the doxorubicin metabolites accumulate in the ascites and cleared more slowly from the peritoneal compartment than from the serum. Accumulation in the peritoneal cavity with prolonged half-life should be considered when administering medication in patients with ascites. In lungs cancer the aggregate results of the present series of studies demonstrate that RLIP76 is the predominant doxorubicin transporter in lung cancer cell. That its transport and ATPase activity is greater in NSCLC than SCLC and that its inhibition by anti-RLIP76 IgG augments doxorubicin cytotoxicity though it’s increased accumulation in cells. In neurotumor cells the doxorubicin-induced apoptosis is ceramide-mediated and whether p53 up-regulation is necessary for the apoptotic response.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Ajay Kumar and Babita Gautam and Chetan Dubey and Puspendra Kumar Tripathi', 'eprint': 'http://ijpsr.com/bft-article/a-review-role-of-doxorubicin-in-treatment-of-cancer/?view=fulltext', 'journal': 'International Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Research', 'number': '10', 'pages': '4105', 'publisher': 'International Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Research', 'title': 'A review: role of doxorubicin in treatment of cancer', 'url': 'http://ijpsr.com/bft-article/a-review-role-of-doxorubicin-in-treatment-of-cancer/?view=fulltext', 'volume': '5', 'year': 2014}, 'citedby': 5, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:6DzZfY3qH5gC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '8625812700739428588', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Plexus block is the preferred anesthesia plan for upper limb surgeries.

Following the bankruptcy of a local peer, non-filing local firms significantly reduce investment expenditures, reduce capital structure leverage, and hold more cash. The effects of local bankruptcy are more pronounced when the CEO of the filing firm is dismissed, and stronger among firms managed by CEOs who are relatively young, have fewer qualifications, and relatively short tenure. Firms that have board connections with the bankrupt firms also react more strongly to the distress events. Importantly, the spillover effects associated with geographic proximity cannot be explained by intra-industry or supply chain effects documented in the extant literature. We also find that the effects cannot be explained by shocks to the local economy.

An unstructured questionnaire (for interview) was designed to understand the CSR practices of Future group and communication of the same to its various stakeholders. CSR practices in Indian retail industry specifically in future group are in a formative stage, characterized by being unstructured, informal and sometimes, inconsistent. For example, Future group …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Amresh Kumar', 'journal': 'International Journal of Retailing & Rural Business Perspectives', 'number': '3', 'pages': '584', 'publisher': 'Pezzottaite Journals', 'title': 'Corporate Social Responsibility in Organized Retail: An Insight into the Initiatives of Future group', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13554945178945571336&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'volume': '2', 'year': 2013}, 'citedby': 5, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:QsaTk4IG4EwC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '13554945178945571336', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small">3D FFT is a very data and compute intensive kernel encountered in many applications.

Open access to the transmission system places an emphasis on the intensive use of the interconnected network reliably, which requires knowledge of the network capability. Available Transfer Capability (ATC) is a measure of the remaining power transfer capability of the transmission network for further transactions. This paper describes the assessment of ATC using AC Power transfer distribution factors (ACPTDFs) in combined economic emission dispatch (CEED) environment. The ACPTDFs are derived using sensitivity based approach for the system intact case and utilized to check the line flow limits during ATC determination. The obtained ATC results are compared with Newton Raphson Load Flow method (NRLF) to justify its accuracy. Simultaneous bilateral and multilateral wheeling transactions have been carried out on IEEE 6 and 30 bus systems for the assessment of ATC.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Anup Kumar and Mukesh Kumar', 'eprint': 'https://www.ripublication.com/irph/ijict_spl/07_ijictv3n11spl.pdf', 'journal': 'Int.

Analysis and design of a pipe network system is a complex and time taking work. Now a day’s lot of pipe software is available which can be used suitably for layout and analysis of pipe network system. Working with professional software requires both money and training. Sometimes it is required to design a simple pipe network system for which an easy method will be suitable. In this paper a simple method is discussed which can be used suitably for optimal design of pipe networks for the water distribution system. The problem in this paper has thus been solved with a view to reduce the total cost of pipe network satisfying the required amount discharge in the outlet. Hardy Cross method has been used for estimating the required discharge in each outlet of the pipe network, and optimization of the system has been done to reduce the cost with the help of Microsoft-excel. The proposed optimization setup has been very close to the original value, thereby validating its use for optimization.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Briti Sundar Sil and Preetam Banerjee and Ajeet Kumar and P Jarken Bui and Pallavi Saikia', 'eprint': 'https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3085/47cd2669c54dce74869d6766d2223fe0c896.pdf', 'journal': 'International journal of hydraulic engineering', 'number': '4', 'pages': '59-63', 'title': 'Use of excel-solver as an optimization tool in design of pipe network', 'url': 'https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3085/47cd2669c54dce74869d6766d2223fe0c896.pdf', 'volume': '2', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 5, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:MIUEjqm7qCUC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '7296578941415457926', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><h3 class="gsh_h3">Objectives:</h3><div class="gsh_csp"></div><div> To determine the maximal mouth opening (MMO) in children aged 3 to 5 years from Indian population and to examine the possible influence of age, gender, height and body weight on MMO. </div><h3 class="gsh_h3">Study Design:</h3><div class="gsh_csp"></div><div> Assessment of MMO is accomplished with a modified Vernier Caliper by measuring the distance between the incisal edge of upper and lower incisor during maximal mouth opening upto the painless limit.

Domino logic is a CMOS based evolution of the dynamic logic techniques based on either PMOS or NMOS transistors. It allows a rail-to-rail logic swing. It was developed to speed up circuits in Dynamic Logic. They have smaller areas than conventional CMOS logic (as does all Dynamic Logic) and parasitic capacitances are smaller so that higher operating speeds are possible. There are many solutions to the problem of how to cascade dynamic logic gates. One way is Domino Logic, which inserts an ordinary static inverter between stages. While this might seem to defeat the point of dynamic logic, since the inverter has a PFET (one of the main goals of Dynamic Logic is to avoid PFETs where possible, due to speed), there are two reasons it works well.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Permendra Kr Verma and SK Singh and Amit Kumar and Sanjay Singh', 'eprint': 'http://www.ijstr.org/final-print/june2012/Design-And-Analysis-of-Logic-Gates-Using-Static-And-Domino-Logic-Technique.pdf', 'journal': 'International Journal of Scientific & Technology Research', 'number': '5', 'pages': '122-125', 'title': 'Design and Analysis of Logic Gates Using Static and Domino Logic Technique', 'url': 'http://www.ijstr.org/paper-references.php?ref=IJSTR-0612-5234', 'volume': '1', 'year': 2012}, 'citedby': 5, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:sbeIDTyQOFgC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '12450359108780914597', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">The energy economics of potato and gram crop production operation in Allahabad region is reported in the present study. The main focus of this study was to study the operation and source wise energy inputs for potato and gram crop under traditional and partial mechanized farming system and to analyze and compare the cost benefits of partial mechanised farming over traditional farming. The various operations in the production of crops like sowing, intercultural and harvesting and picking were considered for the operation energy input determination. It was observed that in both crop energy required in sowing, intercultural and harvesting/picking operation was more in traditional farming. It means that mechanized farming saves the much more energy input in operation and reduces the cost. After analyzing the cost of energy, it was clear that the cost of energy is 1.2 times more in gram crop for traditional farming as compared to mechanized farming. But in potato crop, the cost of energy approx doubles in traditional as compared to mechanized farming. It was also found that mechanized farming of gram crop and potato crop shows the significant saving in operational energy as well.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'SK Himanshu and S Kumar and A Kumar and KK Gupta', 'eprint': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sanjeev_Kumar122/publication/264196866_Energy_Economics_Assessment_of_Crops_in_Traditional_and_Mechanized_Farming/links/53d1db780cf228d363e8f020.pdf', 'journal': 'International Research J.

The sand bed of 500mm thick was compacted at a relative density of 90% in dry state and is reinforced with four geosynthetic products viz., Polymeric Woven Geotextile, uni-axial geogrids of two different capacities and a coir geotextile. The size, shape, depth of placement and the surcharge were maintained same. A square model footing of 100mm size was used as the loading unit.

This paper proposes an integrated system for WVSN (mainly used for surveillance) that combines the use of adaptive cooperative diversity and fuzzy logic. The cooperative spacetime block codes (STBC) are used to achieve full diversity with a simple maximum-likelihood decoding algorithm in order to enhance the performance of the considered WVSN. The performance comparison between the proposed system and a non-cooperative scheme is presented based on network lifetime, quality of transmitted videos, and required number of retransmissions under varying propagation scenarios in a WVSN.

An attempt is made to modify the black disc formula σabs= σ0 Aα, based on the Glauber multiple-scattering model. Pion absorption cross-section is calculated for three groups of targets viz. light nuclei, intermediate nuclei and heavy nuclei. The absorption cross-section may be considered as the difference of the total crosssection and the elastic cross-section. The mechanism of the absorption of hadrons with complex nuclei has been studied by several physicists [1-11]. Different fittings and parameterizations were proposed for the absorption cross-section of hadrons. The dependence of absorption cross-section upon the atomic weight of the target ‘A’is well described by the power function σabs= σ0 Aα, where, σ0 and α are two adjustable parameters depending upon the value of the total cross-section for particle interactions with nucleon [8-14]. For obtaining better fit of the experimental data the values of the parameter σ0 and α are adjusted by the method of least squares.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'TS Saini and JP Gupta and P Shroti and A Agrawal and A Kumar', 'eprint': 'http://inspirehep.net/record/1428035/files/D8.pdf', 'journal': 'DAE Symp.

Pregnancy disruption was also seen in mice which were housed on male rat-soiled bedding. By contrast, inseminated mice housed with female rats or on bedding soiled by female rats showed a significantly lower rate of pregnancy failure. The presence of the stud male prevented the pregnancy failure in mice induced by exposure to male rats or male rat-soiled bedding. This protective effect of the stud male on pregnancy in rat-exposed mice is analogous to the protective effect of the stud male on pregnancy in conspecific novel male-exposed mice and in mice subjected to nutritional stress. Hence the possibility that the protective effect of the stud male on pregnancy in male rat-exposed mice is due to the stimulation of luteotrophic activity by the stud male-originating olfactory cues cannot be ruled out. However, it is not clear whether the pregnancy failure in newly inseminated mice induced by exposure to rats is the result of a general stress or is mediated through rat-originating chemosignals acting interspecifically.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'A Kumar and CJ Dominic', 'journal': 'Indian journal of experimental biology', 'number': '3', 'pages': '191-196', 'title': 'Rat-induced disruption of early pregnancy in mice and its prevention by the stud male.', 'url': 'https://europepmc.org/abstract/med/8781027', 'volume': '34', 'year': 1996}, 'citedby': 5, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:8igAKu_hPxwC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '9511288568843224642', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'author': 'A Kumar and GM Whitesides', 'pages': '172-COLL', 'publisher': 'AMER CHEMICAL SOC', 'title': 'Patterning Self-Assembled Monolayers-Applications in Microelectronics and Biotechnology', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=18392601801353027890&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'volume': '206', 'year': 1993}, 'citedby': 5, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:vzY-6mMDyDUC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '18392601801353027890', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div><div><div class="gsh_csp">Burns greater than 15–30 per cent body surface area (BSA) are associated both with an acquired immunologic deficiency in the cell-mediated thymus-regulated immunity and a significant increase in the glucocorticoid levels.

However, for significant friction reduction at low cost, the microchannel wall needs to be chemically inhomogeneous. The direct fluid dynamic consequence of this requirement is a spatial variation in the local degree of liquid slippage. In this work, the pressure-driven flow in a channel with periodically patterned slippage on the channel walls is studied using a spectrally accurate semi-analytical approach based on Fourier decomposition. The method puts no restrictions on the pitch (or wavelength) and amplitude of the pattern. The predicted effective slip length in the limits of small pattern amplitude and thick channels is found to be consistent with previously published results.

Due to these reasons the importance of oil shales has increased in last 20 years. Nowadays many countries have started the extraction at commercial level with the help of hydro–fracturing. Oil shale is a compact laminated sedimentary rock containing solid organic matter known as kerogen. These oil shales are also known as unconventional reserves of energy sources. The principal environments in which oil shale is deposited are (1) large lakes;(2) shallow sea on continental platforms and continental shelves, and (3) small lakes, bogs, and lagoons. Oil shales are formed by the process of deposition and lithification of fine mineral and organic matters at the bottom of water bodies. All deposits are micro stratified which shows the unsteady environmental conditions. The complete formation process occurs below 150oC and degradation of organic matter occurs due to the aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The oil bearing shales around the world are located at the depth varying between 500 m to 4000 m. The most common approach for oil extraction is drastically breaking the bond of the organics which involves retorting process. The two approaches for retorting are surface retorting and in–situ processing. Upon heating (retorting) oil shale at temperatures in the range of 300 to 400 C, the kerogen decomposes into oil, gas and residual carbon in a process referred to as pyrolysis.

Next, the presence of long memory in conditional volatility is tested using ARMA-FIGARCH and ARMA-FIAPARCH models under various distributional assumptions. The results confirm the presence of long memory in conditional variance for two models. In the last part, the presence of long memory in conditional mean and conditional variance is verified using ARFIMA-FIGARCH and ARFIMA-FIAPARCH models.

Community access to information and ICT services is not in itself a new concept. Besides, it provides an encouraging policy approach to overcoming the wide disparities of access to information, particularly in the education sector. ICT services can provide opportunities for disabled students especially speechless students to participate in the newly emerging social and economic orders. A vast number of students have no obstacles to communicate or learn through the many technological educational tools that provide different functionalities and services. Even though the technology is becoming more incredible and sophisticated, there is not much of the development and improvement in the communication systems and learning or education application systems for speech disabled students. This paper, therefore, presents a new concept aimed at developing a basic learning and communication system for school children with speech disabilities using mobile platforms in the developing world.

Although the general specification of UWB is a frequency spectrum of 3.1 GHz to 10.6 GHz, but it can actually be any band of frequency of minimum 20% of the center frequency on both sides. For wireless communication it is desired to use an antenna which will be compact in size and shall operate in multi or broadband environment. Because of its unique characteristics a fractal antenna provides us with those. Fractal antenna can be designed to receive and transmit over a wide range of frequencies using the self-similarity properties associated with fractal geometry structures. Fractal antennas are multiresonant and smaller in size. They also have better input impedance matching and are virtually frequency independent. Therefore, fractal today provides a wide range of wireless applications.

Four fungal genera namely, Pythium, Rhizochtonia-like, Fusarium, and Sclerotium-like were isolated from discolored roots. Among these, Pythium isolates were most predominant. Succeeding pathogenicity test on rice variety Apo, however, revealed that only a few of these isolates are actually pathogenic. This is contrary to previous reports in 2005 where most of the Pythium isolated tested pathogenic to rice variety Apo. This apparent shift in the Pythium population composition may have been caused by the inundation of top soil from an unknown off-site location during a strong typhoon in late 2006. Among the recent isolates, only one was highly pathogenic causing pre-emergence damping-off and stunting of seedlings that were able to emerge.

In the literature, the discussions on impact of government policy on corporate performance primarily stress on macroeconomic aspects of industrial behavior and broad measures of industrial performance. They offer inadequate understanding of the mechanisms through which firms\' performance is affected. This study attempts to fill in this void. It specifically endeavours to answer the research question: how Industrial policy affects performance of the firms? For empirical evidence, we considered the case of CNC Machine Tool industry in India. The study is primarily exploratory and qualitative based on case studies. The study endeavors to explain the policy-performance causation placing resources of the firms at the center of analysis. The three elements of the causality chain: policy, resource and performance are the building blocks of our analysis. The policy is seen in terms of technology, investment, education and training, market development and industrial governance. The resource is segmented as research, development and engineering; manufacturing; human; marketing and linkage. All these are further elaborated in terms of three more constructs: capability, mechanism and indicator.

My analysis also shows that portfolios recommended by both momentum following and contrarian newsletters are capable of outperforming a fully invested benchmark portfolio. The newsletter recommended portfolios have positive Sharpe ratios, lower beta with respect to the market and a positive Jensen\'s alpha. Overall, these results indicate that by using simple trading strategies and proper timing, some newsletters are able to exhibit superior performance.

This paper discusses experiences in three different farming systems prevailing in Gujarat, Haryana and Karnataka and addresses some of the issues relevant for the farmers\' adoption of urea treated straw (UTS). The extension programs under study were not preceded by an exante analysis to establish whether farmers would be likely to benefit from UTS technology. As a result, after initial on-farm trials, many farmers, discontinued the use of this technology. The paper discusses the adoption of UTS in the context of four elements of the adoption process, ie the technology itself, the farmer, the extension agency and infrastructural facilities. Data were collected through an interview from a cross-section of farmers that were exposed to UTS technology in the three states. Most of the respondents perceived UTS as a simple, somewhat profitable and low cost technology provided that urea was supplied free of cost. Many failed to appreciate the value of UTS in increasing milk production. The farmers were of the opinion that urea can be better used in crop production rather than on treatment of straws and they did not perceive the need for UTS. Negative experiences associated with UTS were risk of fungal spoilage, sticky dung or loose dung and poor keeping quality, though these experiences are not a rule. Other reasons for discontinuation of this technology included the nonavailability of urea, straw, labour and/or water. Questions to be answered before taking this technology to the field, include i) to which category of farmers is this technology useful ii) what message is to be …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'SVN Rao and CB Singh and MN Amrith Kumar and OP Gahlot', 'eprint': 'http://edepot.wur.nl/333325#page=463', 'journal': 'Feeding of ruminants on fibrous crop residues.

Such chronic methaqualone treatment caused an enhancement of microsomal drug metabolizing enzymes catalyzed N-demethylations of diphenhydramine, pethidine, morphine and aromatic hydroxylation of aniline. A single oral dose of methaqualone (60 mg/kg) did not result in any significant change in the activities of drug metabolizing enzymes.

In vertebrate genomes, vGAF associates with purine-rich GAGA sequences and performs diverse chromatin-mediated functions, viz., gene activation, repression and enhancer blocking. Expansion of regulatory chromatin proteins with the acquisition of PTMs appears to be the general trend that facilitated the evolution of complexity in vertebrates.

Annual flows into hedge funds with positively skewed returns are 11.5% higher than comparable funds with negatively skewed returns. Evaluating hedge fund performance using a new performance measure that accounts for return skewness leads to superior ex-ante fund selection. During the 1994 to 2009 period, the average improvement in out-of-sample annual performance is 2%. Our measure is particularly valuable during periods of economic crisis when returns are more likely to exhibit skewness and the improvement in annual performance is about 4%.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Andrea J Heuson and Mark C Hutchinson and Alok Kumar', 'journal': 'Available at SSRN 2448486', 'title': 'Skewness, fund flows, and hedge fund performance', 'url': 'https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2448486', 'year': 2016}, 'citedby': 3, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:T4xR6ACgc60C', 'id_scholarcitedby': '16606059598575785340', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Succession is one of the most important decisions a family managed business faces, for continuity and growth.

So, the present work describes the development of Reverse Phase-High Performance Liquid Chromatography (RP-HPLC) method by QbD approach using Design of Experiments and subsequent validation for analysis of Vildagliptin in bulk drug and its pharmaceutical formulation. An efficient experimental design based on systematic scouting of all three key components of the RP‐HPLC method (Buffer pH, Organic Phase-% acetonitrile, Organic Modifier-Methanol) is presented. The significance and interaction effects of these parameters on the response variables (Retention time and tailing factor) were evaluated through statistical analysis tools like Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and plots which revealed the final chromatographic conditions of the method. The developed method was validated and Forced degradation studies were also carried out in order to determine the stability-indicating nature of the method. The chromatographic separation was achieved on Jasco CrestPack RP C18 (250× 4.6 mm, 5μ) column using Buffer (pH 6): Acetonitrile: Methanol (70: 10: 20 v/v) as mobile phase and detection was done using Photo-Diode Array (PDA) detector at 210 nm.

We prove that when the controller action set is constrained the cost function turns out to be a Lyapunov candidate function thereby guaranteeing stability of the controller.

This paper is aimed to review the scientific information concerning the potential health benefits and adverse effects associated with phytate in foods. The adverse health effects of phytate in the diet is its effect on mineral uptake. Minerals of concern in this regard would include Zn 2+, Fe 2+/3+, Ca 2+, Mg 2+, Mn 2+, and Cu 2+. Especially zinc and iron deficiencies were reported as a consequence of high phytate intakes. In addition, a the adverse effect on the nutritional value of protein by dietary phytate is discussed. Consumption of phytate, however, seems not to have only adverse health effects but also potential benefits on human health. Dietary phytate was reported to prevent kidney stone formation, protect against diabetes mellitus, caries, atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease as well as against a variety of cancers.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Habtamu Fekadu Gemede', 'eprint': 'http://scientiaresearchlibrary.com/archive/JASR-2014-2-3-054-19-31.pdf', 'journal': 'Journal of Applied Science And Research', 'number': '3', 'pages': '19-31', 'title': 'Scientia Research Library ISSN 2348-0416', 'url': 'http://scientiaresearchlibrary.com/archive/JASR-2014-2-3-054-19-31.pdf', 'volume': '2', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 3, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:ktX0m338QuYC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '594386528618216701', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small">From the recent years the large volume of data is growing bigger and bigger.

However, in all such algorithms, a fixed path is returned always for the same start and goal positions in the environment. Recently, Perlin noise has been used to add variations to a path so that it appears more natural. However, because of pure random nature of Perlin noise function, often unnatural path occurs.

The model is applied to germanium nanowires and germanium two-dimensional channels to study and compare spin relaxation between them. Spin dephasing in germanium occurs because of Rashba Spin Orbit Interaction (structural inversion asymmetry) which gives rise to the D’yakonov-Perel (DP) relaxation. In germanium spin flip scattering due to the Elliot-Yafet (EY) mechanism also leads to spin relaxation. The spin relaxation tests for both 1D and 2D channels are carried out at different values of temperature and driving electric field, and the variation in spin relaxation length is recorded. Spin relaxation length in a nanowire is found to be much higher than that in a 2D channel due to suppression of DP relaxation in a nanowire. At lower temperatures the spin relaxation length increases. This suggests that spin relaxation in germanium occurs slowly in a 1D channel (nanowires) and at lower temperatures. The electric field dependence of spin relaxation length was found to be very weak.</div></div>', 'author': 'Ashish Kumar and MW Akram and Bahniman Ghosh', 'eprint': 'http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/isrn.nanomaterials/2012/207043.pdf', 'journal': 'ISRN Nanomaterials', 'publisher': 'Hindawi Publishing Corporation', 'title': 'Spin Relaxation in Germanium Nanowires', 'url': 'http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/isrn.nanomaterials/2012/207043.pdf', 'volume': '2012', 'year': 2012}, 'citedby': 3, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:quBVm8e4N6QC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '14773401717574953816', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">In context of web mining, large collection of web documents are used in the process of mining to extract more useful information.

Due non-reliable braking of the automotive, the movement of automotive in hill stations especially in hair pin bend the automotive will lose its control due to over speed and also improper braking mechanism. This actually results in large number of automotive accidents in hill stations across Tamil Nadu and in India, which results in huge loss of lives. The automotive manufacturing companies often call its units back due to fault design mechanism which they realize only when their customers loss their lives.

The chromogen exhibit maximum absorbance at 627 nm with molar absorptivity of 5.205 x 104 lit mol-1 cm-1 in methanol. Beer’s law was found to be obeyed in the concentration range of 30-65 µg mL-1 with linear regression of 0.9984, while the percentage recovery and the limit of detection 98.81-99.91%, 5.5 µg mL-1 respectively.

Our results indicate that both retail and institutional investors are more likely to trade stocks with similar characteristics. Further, investors\' trades are correlated with retail trades exhibiting stronger correlations. Using different measures of comovements, including geography-and price-based comovements, we demonstrate that correlated retail trading generates stronger comovement patterns while informed institutional trading weakens them. Comovements are stronger among stocks that have lottery features, are located in regions where people enjoy gambling, or are held by retail investors with strong gambling propensity. Across time, trading correlations and comovements are amplified during periods of greater market-level uncertainty and stronger consumer sentiment. Overall, these results are consistent with the habitat-based view of return comovements proposed in Barberis, Shleifer, and Wurgler (2005).</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Alok Kumar and Jeremy K Page and Oliver G Spalt', 'eprint': 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.372.6049&rep=rep1&type=pdf', 'journal': 'AFA 2011 Denver Meetings Paper', 'title': 'Investor Clienteles and Habitat-Based Return Comovements', 'url': 'https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1461855', 'year': 2010}, 'citedby': 3, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '2012746095972820112', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small">The influence of ICT in developing countries makes more demand for web based and reliable information.

The various avionics sub-systems have varied requirements for services that generate a wide range of traffic patterns. Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) provides a robust way to offer such services, but measures have to be taken to make sure that the bandwidth is effectively utilized. Using Optical Time Division Multiplexing (OTDM) with WDM increases the bandwidth usage per wavelength in the WDM system, thereby increasing the effective utilization of the system capacity.

However, to date, there are no imaging modalities available for non-invasive detection of vascular gene expression. We have developed an optical imaging method to track vascular gene expression by detecting fluorescent signals emitted from arterial walls following gene transfer. To investigate the feasibility of this new technique, we performed experiments on a set of human tissue-like phantoms using a common biological marker in gene therapy, the green fluorescent protein (GFP). The phantoms were constructed to mimic the arterial geometry beneath a tissue layer. Human smooth muscle cells transfected with GFP were embedded in a capillary tube in the phantom. Monte Carlo modeling of the phantom experiment was performed to optimize the performance of the optical imaging system.

The mechanical response of rubber is dependent on time, temperature and mode of loading. It is susceptible to explosive decompression damage. Rubber’s non-linear stress-strain curves, creep, hysteresis and other properties are influenced not only by the method of fabrication but also by age. If these characteristics are not accounted for properly, the result can be less precision in design compared with metals.

The model has been employed for deriving conditions under which the crystal radius during growth can be kept a constant. Two parameters that influence the size of the crystal are the pull velocity and the base temperature of the crucible. The present work explores the sensitivity of the crystal radius to these parameters. The mathematical model is based on one dimensional unsteady heat conduction in the solid phase with radiation to the enclosure. The model can predict the time-wise variation of the pull velocity and the base temperature so that the radius of the crystal can be maintained constant to within a prescribed tolerance. Materials considered for analysis are silicon and Nd:YAG. The analysis can account for variation in transport properties with temperature and differences in properties between the liquid melt and the crystalline solid. Results derived in the present work show that the crystal radius exhibits greater sensitivity to the pull velocity as compared to the crucible base temperature.</div></div>', 'author': 'Amit Kumar and Jyotirmay Banerjee and K Muralidhar', 'eprint': 'http://nopr.niscair.res.in/bitstream/123456789/17721/1/JSIR%2061%288%29%20607-616.pdf', 'publisher': 'NISCAIR-CSIR, India', 'title': 'Thermal modeling of crystal growth by the Czochralski method including radius control', 'url': 'http://nopr.niscair.res.in/handle/123456789/17721', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 3, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:Y6EZgx1ah38C', 'id_scholarcitedby': '18176556083217632035', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"> <div class="gsh_csp">A facile synthesis of cis-3,3a-dithydro-3-arylspiro [cycloalkane-1 \' ,7 (8H) [6H] pyrazolo [3 \' ,4 \' :4,5] thiazolo [3,2-b]-s-tetrazines (3) has been achieved by the condensation of 1,2,4,5-tetraazaspiro 5,7 tridecane-3-thione (1a) or 1,2,4,5-tetraazaspiro [5,6] dodecane3-thione (1b) or 1,2,4, 5-tetraazaspiro [5,5] undecane-3-thione (1c) with ethyl chloroacetate and aldehydes in the presence of pyridine and piperidine to yield 7-arylidene-6 (7H) -oxospiro [cycloctane/cycloheptane/cyclohexane]-1,3 (4H)-[2H] thiazolo [3,2-b]-s-tetrazines (2) followed by treatment with 2,4-dinitrophenyl hydrazine.

The next section considers the relationship of equality to fertility and health levels.  Then conditions in Manipur and Kerala are described to bolster the argument that greater political participation and collective action by women are necessary precursors to socioeconomic improvement.  The chapter concludes that it is a national disgrace for India that only 13 countries in the world have a lower GDI than the states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar while these two Indian states are home to twice as many people than those 13 countries.  It was also found that there is no predictable relationship between income and gender equity since the status of women is among the lowest in India in two of the richest states Haryana and Punjab.  The third finding is that higher levels of development and greater sex equity lead to lower fertility rates.  A related result of the analysis is that the states that enjoy good levels of health Kerala and Manipur have offered women greater freedom and opportunities to exercise political authority through collective public action.

India is one of the few countries where significant inequities are evident in the sex ratio of the 0-6 year age group.  A United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF) report identified 8 states (Uttar Pradesh Rajasthan Punjab Haryana Gujurat Maharashtra Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu) where prenatal sex determination and female feticide are widely practiced; this accounted for 1.4 million "missing" girl children.  Abortions are legal under the Indian Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act 1972.  In the late 1980s the state of Maharashtra made the use of sex-determination tests for the purpose of terminating female fetus pregnancies illegal.  Other Indian states followed suit and on January 1 1996 the Indian parliament gave its formal assent to the Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Regulation and Misuse) Act.  The state government of Delhi enacted the Delhi Artificial Insemination (Human) Act in 1995 which for the first time in India legalized the donation of semen and oocytes to infertile couples.  Semen banks are registered under the supervisory authority of the director of Health Services.

Acceleration is computed or estimated continuously at each step to guide the interceptor. However, computation of acceleration is time consuming and often leads to inaccuracy, especially when the target is high maneuvering. Keeping this in view, a proportional navigation based guidance law for the interception of a high maneuvering target is presented that does not require estimation of the target’s acceleration to generate guidance command. The method is based on anticipating target’s trajectory using simple linear extrapolation and rotational correction. The interceptor predicts next position of the target and continuously adjusts its acceleration command to move towards the future position of the target.

In the same context, perfluorohexane, a low thermal conductivity liquid has been used for the insulation of tumour. In the presence of a perfluorohexane layer, results demonstrate that the lethal front and the freezing front do not cross the tumour boundary. The results of numerical modelling indicate that there is an optimal thickness of the perfluorohexane layer which enables a perfect insulation to the tumour. Further, the contour plot presents that the optimal thickness of the perfluorohexane layer is 1 mm. The results also suggest that the lethal front reaches the tumour boundary at 100 s when perfluorohexane is used as an insulation at the tumour boundary.

To design wells for safe operation under these aggressive conditions, a high SSC resistance of low alloy steel casing is demanded.

For the purpose of analysis, daily return data is taken from equity markets, viz. Bombay Stock Exchange SENSEX, Tokyo Stock Exchange NIKKEI 225, Hong Kong Shanghai Index (HSI), Amman Equity Index, Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI), and Singapore Strait Time Index (STI), from 03/01/2000 to 31/12/2013. The results show that the Asian markets are co-integrated in the long run. Further, it is found that a significant part of each market’s volatility pattern at intraweek scale can be largely explained by own shocks, but in the long run the volatility dynamics of the market changes as the extent of the spillover increases. From the wavelet multiple cross-correlation values, two developed markets, the STI and the HSI, are identified as potential leaders or followers among the group. From the analysis it is found that the volatility spillover across the studied markets is relatively low at the high frequency, implying that there is possibility of diversification at a daily to intraweek scale. The discrepancies between the markets vanish in the long run; hence a long-term diversification strategy is best avoided.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Anoop S Kumar and B Kamaiah', 'eprint': 'http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/img/doi/0013-3264/2017/0013-32641712063K.pdf', 'journal': 'Ekonomski Anali/Economic Annals', 'number': '212', 'title': 'RETURNS AND VOLATILITY SPILLOVER BETWEEN ASIAN EQUITY MARKETS: A WAVELET APPROACH.', 'url': 'http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/img/doi/0013-3264/2017/0013-32641712063K.pdf', 'volume': '62', 'year': 2017}, 'citedby': 2, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:L2DjCdFNi3gC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '8975100447372939651', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"> <div class="gsh_csp">Nanomixed SnO<sub>2</sub>–Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> with variable composition has been synthesized by sol–gel technique using aluminium dichloride and stannous chloride as precursors.

The xy orbital is found to be mainly responsible for the generation of strong ferromagnetic spin coupling in the b direction, which is critically important to fully account for the spin wave dispersion as measured in inelastic neutron scattering experiments. The ferromagnetic spin coupling is strongly suppressed as the xy band approaches half filling, and is ascribed to particle-hole exchange in the partially filled xy band. The strongest AF spin coupling in the a direction is found to be in the orbital off-diagonal sector involving the xz and xy orbitals.

However, only institutional investors are able to exploit geographical accessibility to improve their performance. These effects are stronger when more information is locally available in geographically accessible regions. During the 1995-2014 period, a Long-Short trading strategy that exploits geographical-accessibility-induced informational advantage of institutions yields an annual risk-adjusted abnormal performance of about 4%.

Not only is the global burden of refractive error very high, but also increasing every day. A number of associated serious complications and the various modes of treatment aspect of the refractive errors, warrants the necessity to explore the various factors that have impact on them. The present study was done with the purpose of establishing the relation of refractive error with corneal curvature of the eye in adult subjects. This study was done on one thousand eyes, of five hundred adult cases, over a total period of 2 years. The cases included were of both sex’s male and female, taken from Patiala and around Patiala. The subjects were recruited on the basis of inclusion criteria: refractive error-myopia and hyperopia, aged between 20-40 years. The subjects in our study included students of MBBS (Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery) and BDS (Bachelor of Dental Sciences) and routine OPD (outpatient door) patients falling in the range of concern of my study. The instruments used in this study were: Auto refractor and Auto keratometer for measuring refractive error and corneal curvature respectively. Each subject was explained thoroughly about the whole procedure. Their informed written consent was also taken. General examination was done in each and every case.

It states that a financial market can undergo a crisis when a particular trading time horizon gains prominence over others. We test this proposition using data from two major Indian capital market indices namely BSE SENSEX and NSE NIFTY and one bond market index NSE GSEC. Here, a wavelet based method is applied in order to capture the activities in different timescales. We take daily returns of all the indices from 04-01-1999 to 12-09-2013 for the purpose of the analysis. The time period includes the dot-com crash and the 2008 global financial crisis as well as two general elections in India. During the crisis period, the market behavior is marked by an increased activity among all timescales as proposed by the fractal market hypothesis. From the results, it is evident that Indian equity markets are influenced possibly by internal political turbulence, financial crisis in international capital markets and change in investor behavior during extreme events.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Anoop S KUMAR and Kamaiah BANDI', 'eprint': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Swetadri_Samadder/publication/282185179_INVESTIGATION_OF_NONLINEARITY_AND_CHAOS_IN_PRIME_INDIAN_AND_AMERICAN_STOCK_EXCHANGE_INDICES/links/5606c92108ae8e08c091fbf1/INVESTIGATION-OF-NONLINEARITY-AND-CHAOS-IN-PRIME-INDIAN-AND-AMERICAN-STOCK-EXCHANGE-INDICES.pdf#page=84', 'journal': 'Hyperion International Journal of Econophysics & New Economy', 'number': '1', 'title': 'EXPLAINING FINANCIAL CRISIS BY FRACTAL MARKET HYPOTHESIS: EVIDENCES FROM INDIAN EQUITY MARKETS.', 'url': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Swetadri_Samadder/publication/282185179_INVESTIGATION_OF_NONLINEARITY_AND_CHAOS_IN_PRIME_INDIAN_AND_AMERICAN_STOCK_EXCHANGE_INDICES/links/5606c92108ae8e08c091fbf1/INVESTIGATION-OF-NONLINEARITY-AND-CHAOS-IN-PRIME-INDIAN-AND-AMERICAN-STOCK-EXCHANGE-INDICES.pdf#page=84', 'volume': '8', 'year': 2015}, 'citedby': 2, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:JQOojiI6XY0C', 'id_scholarcitedby': '11239671618678205959', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp"><b>e15610</b></div> <div class="gsh_csp"> <b>Background: </b> Hepatotoxicity has been observed in about 40-50% renal cancer patients treated with Pazopanib in clinical trials.

The price consciousness, brand consciousness, quality consciousness, and brand loyalty for the FMCGs do not vary across different age groups, family sizes, genders, and occupations of the poor. Poor prefer to purchase the FMCGs from local retail shops and pay in cash. They purchase well known national brands in FMCGs and their main information sources of these brands are TV advertising &amp; family members.

However with the introduction of public key cryptography and dynamic reconfiguration in IP enabled sensing devices for use in several “Internet of Things” applications, dynamic memory allocation in embedded devices, is becoming more important than ever before. While several embedded operating systems like MantisOS, SOS and Contiki provide dynamic memory allocation support, they usually lack flexibility or have relatively large memory overhead.

Several works have been proposed to make it dynamic one for increasing the efficiency by decreasing the average waiting time, average turnaround time and context switching. The advantage of Round Robin and Dynamic Round Robin is that both are starvation free. The proposed Task set based Adaptive Round Robin (TARR) improves the performance of system in terms of average waiting time, average turnaround time and context switching.

In particular, because of high Q (quality factor) resonators, signal levels at start up can be very low, posing challenges to achieve PLL lock or lead to unacceptable lock times. This paper proposes a novel frequency scan technique to achieve start up and, hence, lock for the loop. The paper describes a comparator circuit to convert the input sinusoid to a clock with in-built band pass filter, dc and ac hysteresis. Also a scheme is proposed to avoid wrong phase at start up which could arise in a resonator loop using charge pump based PLL. All the above techniques are implemented in TSMC 0.18 micron process for the ADXRS290 gyroscope product and results show a reliable PLL lock with startup time &lt;;5 ms for up to a Q of 2500.</div></div>', 'author': 'Anjan Kumar and Abhinav Dikshit and Bill Clark and Jeff Yan', 'eprint': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel7/7031475/7031671/07031710.pdf', 'pages': '71-74', 'publisher': 'IEEE', 'title': 'A frequency scan scheme for pll-based locking to high-q mems resonators', 'url': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7031710/', 'year': 2015}, 'citedby': 2, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:MnogvFdIBdwC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '14536716334795185889', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small">Increasing the cost of fuels, growing concern of global warming and increasing demand of electrical energy, a compact, less polluting and efficient gas turbine power plant with regenerator and a suitable Waste Heat Recovery Steam Generator (WHRSG) presents a very attractive concept.

The work presents the application of Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for image compression, Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) as the efficient selection of pixel locations in cover image and suggests as a new approach to compressed image steganography. We apply the Fourier Transform to our cover image and calculate the coefficients less than or higher than a particular threshold value. These coefficients coordinates are stored in an array. Wavelet transform is applied to the payload image and the approximate coefficients are calculated. These coefficients replace the Fourier coefficients of the original image. The distortion in the stego-image is less when the size of the coefficient matrix is smaller. For the extraction part, the intensity values at the above stored coordinates are extracted and the approximate coefficient matrix is obtained.

Cr is added into Al-Si-Mg alloy by stir casting techniques. Subsequently the alloys were subjected to annealing at 500oC for 1 hour to study the grain growth behavior of these alloys. An optical microscope is used to analyze the grain size and microstructure. The mechanical properties of these alloys were studied using a universal testing machine. The Cr additions were varied between 0.5 to 4 weight percent. The Cr addition had shown a significant effect in refining the grain size of Al-Si-Mg alloys.

Specifically, we conjecture that corporate managers located near major terrorist attacks will experience negative emotions, which would induce them to adopt more conservative corporate policies. Consistent with our conjecture, we demonstrate that firms located near terrorist events increase their cash holdings, and reduce their R&amp;D expenditure and their long-term leverage around the events. These effects are temporary, become weaker as the distance between the firm and the event location increases, and are mainly concentrated among firms managed by younger CEOs.

This paper seeks to explain this market-pricing paradox. In particular, we argue that the lottery-like features of GC stocks attract a predominantly retail clientele who use such stocks to gamble in the market. Such trading behavior leads to underreaction to the GC event itself followed by a continuing fall in prices of almost 20% over the next 12 months. Using first time GC firms from 1993 to 2007 we show that GC stocks have extreme lottery-type characteristics. We further demonstrate that retail investors have a proclivity to be net-buyers of these stocks both at the GC event and subsequently, and such contrarian behavior is directly related to the lottery-like nature of GC firms. We test, and rule out, a range of alternative explanations for why retail investors are net-buyers of GC stocks, and conclude that it is their gambling-type behavior that appears to be driving the short-term market reaction to, and the longer-term market response following, the going-concern audit opinion.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Asad Kausar and Alok Kumar and Richard J Taffler', 'eprint': 'https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/698c/f2274ef3aa28e765aa041f24cc86bb88b743.pdf', 'journal': 'Available at SSRN', 'title': 'Why the going-concern accounting anomaly: gambling in the market?', 'url': 'https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/698c/f2274ef3aa28e765aa041f24cc86bb88b743.pdf', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 2, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:dfsIfKJdRG4C', 'id_scholarcitedby': '16808680720343316079', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp"><h3 class="gsh_h3">Introduction:</h3><div class="gsh_csp"></div> Iodine Deficiency Disorders is among the easiest and least expensive of all nutrient disorders to prevent.

Elemental analyses together with metal estimation confirmed 1: 1 molar ratio of ligand to metal ion of the complexes. IR and electronic absorption spectra showed that L coordinated with metal ions through azomethine-N and phenolic-O. Based on the spectral and analytical data, geometry of each complex was proposed. Corrosion inhibition of the schiff base and its metal complexes were evaluated using weight loss methods in a 0.1 MHCl solution for mild steel. It was found that the compounds had a promising inhibitory action against corrosion of mild steel in the medium investigated. The ligand and its metal chelates were screened for their antimicrobial activities against S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, C. albicans and C. krusei. With the exception against C. krusei, higher activities were exhibited upon coordination of the ligand with metal ions. It was found that Cu (II) and Ni (II) complexes showed the highest antibacterial and antifungal activities, respectively.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Yiheyis Bogale Zemede and D Nithyakalyani and Ananda Kumar', 'eprint': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ananda_Kumar_Srinivasan/publication/264541251_Synthesis_Structural_characterization_corrosion_inhibition_and_in_vitro_antimicrobial_studies_of_2-5-methoxy-2-hydroxybenzylideneamino_phenol_schiff_base_ligand_and_its_transition_metal_complexes/links/544fa1240cf2bca5ce92ab01/Synthesis-Structural-characterization-corrosion-inhibition-and-in-vitro-antimicrobial-studies-of-2-5-methoxy-2-hydroxybenzylideneamino-phenol-schiff-base-ligand-and-its-transition-metal-complexes.pdf', 'journal': 'Synthesis', 'number': '11', 'pages': '4569-4578', 'title': 'Synthesis, Structural Characterization, Corrosion inhibition and in vitro antimicrobial studies of 2-(5-Methoxy-2-Hydroxybenzylideneamino) Phenol Schiff Base ligand and its …', 'url': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ananda_Kumar_Srinivasan/publication/264541251_Synthesis_Structural_characterization_corrosion_inhibition_and_in_vitro_antimicrobial_studies_of_2-5-methoxy-2-hydroxybenzylideneamino_phenol_schiff_base_ligand_and_its_transition_metal_complexes/links/544fa1240cf2bca5ce92ab01/Synthesis-Structural-characterization-corrosion-inhibition-and-in-vitro-antimicrobial-studies-of-2-5-methoxy-2-hydroxybenzylideneamino-phenol-schiff-base-ligand-and-its-transition-metal-complexes.pdf', 'volume': '6', 'year': 2014}, 'citedby': 2, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:6fs0NoO7GbkC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '6422394920067540098', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">In this paper, particle swarm optimization basedoptimal proportional-plus-integral controller is designed for load frequency control of a two area thermal power system.

Incorporation of fly ash in agricultural soils is best alternate use or way to dispose it. Use of fly ash applications may improves the soil conductivity, organic carbon contents, water holding capacity, microbial activity, soil porosity and contains essential nutrients. Thus, fly ash can be used to reclaim problematic soils and increase crop productivity depending upon the nature of soil and fly ash. The micro and macro nutrients present in coal get generally concentrated in the ash. It is by virtue of this and the ability of fly ash to modify the physical, chemical and biological properties of soils that it works as a soil conditioner.

The attention will be on the key sustainable approaches of pharmaceutical industries like the solvent-free reactions, use of alternate reaction media (e.g., water, fluorous alcohols, polyethylene glycols, and ionic liquids), and alternate modes of synthesis such as microwave-assisted synthesis and flow reactions.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Pradeep S Jadhavar and Dinesh Kumar and Priyank Purohit and Bhavin V Pipaliya and Asim Kumar and Srikant Bhagat and Asit K Chakraborti', 'eprint': 'http://www.academia.edu/download/41078848/Book_chapter_Quinoxaline_synthesis.pdf', 'pages': '37-67', 'publisher': 'Springer, New Delhi', 'title': 'Sustainable Approaches Towards the Synthesis of Quinoxalines', 'url': 'https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-81-322-1850-0_2', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 2, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:Fr8DH2VBP9sC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '7920748672311869676', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Objective: The present aim of the work is that the osmotically controlled oral drug delivery system utilizes osmotic pressure for controlled delivery of active agents.

Diversified regional focuses along with collaborations of different international institutes led the sorghum genetic enhancement at ICRISAT in to a six phase strategy beginning from 1972 to till now. In the initial years, the main focus was on development of improved population, composites and open pollinated varieties of sorghum. But with rapid development of hybrid seed industry in Asia and re-orientation of research programs in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), emphasis was laid on developing improved hybrid parents at ICRISAT Patancheru for Asia, and finished products (varieties and hybrids) at other ICRISAT locations in Africa, through partnership research from 1995. Hybrid Parents Research Consortium (HPRC) is a new initiative started in 2000 at ICRISAT, Patancheru with an objective of increasing the scope of accessibility to better hybrids by poor farmers through effective public-private partnerships. So far, ICRISAT has released 250 improved cultivars in collaboration with/transfer materials to NARS across 44 countries in Asia, Africa and America regions between 1975 and 2011. Almost 52.8 per cent of these releases were concentrated in African countries followed by Asia (33.2%) and America (14%). These global releases were composed of 191 varieties and 49 hybrids with diversified traits and targeted niches. These research products aimed at a given location may spill across regions, nations or even across traditional agro-ecological zones.

Thus, finding devices that allow precise detection and monitoring in even the harshest nuclear environment has become one of the key challenges in nuclear energy technology. The detector materials and device structure need to allow fast and accurate measurements at high temperatures as well as survive significant radiation and corrosive environments. While semiconductor based devices fulfill the measurement requirements, current materials (predominantly silicon) are prone to radiation damage and cease functioning at approximately 150 degrees Celsius. Silicon carbide has shown some remarkable properties which can potentially overcome these deficiencies. Among various polytypes of SiC, 4H-SiC exhibits the best electronic properties, possessing a measured electronic mobility of~ 1000 cm2/Vs, high thermal conductivity, wide band gap and low leakage current. These properties make it an ideal candidate material for radiation detection applications. This dissertation aimed to develop a 4H-SiC based detector, and demonstrate its function for radiation detection in harsh conditions. This included the development of multi-scale computational modeling that can predict the long-term performance of the detectors in harsh nuclear environments. For this project, we targeted the extreme conditions found in pyroprocessing, a method used to reprocess spent nuclear fuel with potential importance for next-generation power plants.

Air gap length in an induction motor is already very less; therefore it is not reduced below a certain level. There are three shapes of stator slots-parallel sided, tapered and circular; generally, the tapered or parallel sided shape of stator slot is adopted by manufacturers of induction motors. Here, a comparative study on performance of 3KW induction motor with different shape of stator slots is presented. It is shown that, the induction motor with circular shape of stator slots shows better efficiency, reduced magnetising current and better overload capacity, than the motors with other shapes of stator slots.

To do this the first step is to choose parameter values corresponding to the interpolation points. In a parametric environment, user can completely define a geometric feature with some parameters. This paper has an aim to generate a smooth tool trajectory spline for machining a workpiece. With the spline technique MATLAB program has been proposed for simulation of cutter contact points in the trajectory.

Many factors determine these habitats including investor preferences to size, industry, price-levels and risk-levels. This paper investigates a unique method to explore investment habitat based on the search behavior of investors on the Internet without actually using proprietary trading data. Using Yahoo! Finance data on investors’ frequently coviewing stocks of Russell 3000 stocks between September 15, 2011 and February 24, 2012, we evaluate the return co-movement within investment search habitats/clusters. We find that stocks within a search cluster show strong co-movement with other stocks in the same cluster that is not fully explained by other traditional habitat characteristics. The behavior persists even when a stock moves from one cluster to another. The study provides direct empirical evidence that investors prefer to search among stocks that have similar co-movement.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Alvin Leung and Ashish Agarwal and Prabhudev Konana and Alok Kumar', 'eprint': 'https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5b70/0c65e0d1c16f2a98cf04c4da4290a6095db0.pdf', 'title': 'Online search: Identifying new investment habitats', 'url': 'https://aisel.aisnet.org/icis2012/proceedings/EconomicsValue/15/', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 2, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '7099124709610910097', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small">In this work, we use semiclassical Monte Carlo simulation to study spin transport in silicon germanium nanowires.

The discrete heat sources are traversable along the respective vertical walls. Air, a radiatively transparent medium, is considered to be the cooling medium. The exterior surfaces of the walls of the cavity are assumed to be adiabatic. The governing equations for temperature distribution along the walls of the cavity are obtained by appropriate energy balance between heat generated, conducted, convected and radiated. Calculations pertaining to radiation are performed using enclosure analysis, while the view factors required therein are computed using the crossed-string method of Hottel. The resulting nonlinear partial differential equations are converted into algebraic form using finite difference formulation and are subsequently solved through Gauss-Seidel iterative solver. The effects of various pertinent parameters, viz., heat source position, surface emissivity, convection heat transfer coefficient, thermal conductivity and aspect ratio, on the results of the present problem are studied in detail.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'C Gururaja Rao and A Santhosh Kumar and A Anand Srinivas', 'eprint': 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.656.5305&rep=rep1&type=pdf', 'journal': 'International Journal of Advanced Engineering Technology', 'pages': '172-183', 'title': 'Effect of surface radiation on conjugate convection in a closed and discretely heated rectangular cavity', 'url': 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.656.5305&rep=rep1&type=pdf', 'volume': '2', 'year': 2011}, 'citedby': 2, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:cdwqcPQS8ssC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '14493685506889845435', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">In this work, an improved approach is presented for designing the nearly perfect reconstructed cosine-modulated (CM) filter banks with given stopband attenuation and channel overlapping.

The cutoff frequency is optimized using linear optimization technique such that the filter coefficients values at frequency (/2M ω π=) is approximately equal to 0.707.

Prima facie, the obvious inference is that auction should be a preferred route to allocate scarce resources such as spectrum. However, such an unqualified conclusion warrants an important caveat: that this is conditional upon getting the auction design right. There have been several instances of ill-designed auctions that had unintended consequences of allocating resources at throwaway prices or having fetched such high revenues as to impede the roll-out of services, besides endangering the financial health of the entire sector.

To prevent the copper diffusion and corrosion, the insertion of effective diffusion barrier and capping layers is most important aspects of Cu interconnect technology [2-8]. A large number of refractory metals such as Ti, Ta, Mo, Cr, Co, W, Pd, and Nb and their alloys either in polycrystalline or amorphous phase have been investigated for their diffusion properties in terms of their higher thermal stability and low resistivity [8-10]. A few reports on the investigation of Mo and its alloys have been reported in the literature. In this work, MoN films are deposited by reactive dc magnetron sputtering from a Mo target. The variation of deposition rate and crystalline and amorphous microstructure formation is studied.

While the prior literature has related investment behavior to investors’ religious backgrounds, whether a religious authority’s stock preferences affect equity markets is far less understood. In this paper we study the relevance of a well known religiously motivated stock index, the MSCI US Catholic Values Index (CV400), which is based on opinions of the Catholic Church, to stock market activity and to mutual fund manager behavior. We examine the price and comovement effects of additions and deletions to the index and hypothesize that fund managers located in predominantly Catholic regions (1) show preferences for CV400 stocks relative to the rest of the market and (2) actively trade on changes to the index. We find that generally, CV400 index changes have no impact on constituent stocks’ prices and comovement with their index peers. Catholic managers tilt more towards CV400 stocks than Protestant managers. However, Catholic managers only actively trade in reaction to index changes instigated by a religious authority in a similar manor as they trade in stocks with corresponding financial characteristics. Taken together, our results suggest that institutional investors value the SR attribute of a stock only if the asset would have been chosen on its financial merits alone.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Joshua Golombik and Alok Kumar and Jerry T Parwada', 'journal': 'Available at SSRN 1746564', 'title': 'Does Religion Affect Stock Markets and Institutional Investor Behavior?', 'url': 'https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm?abstractid=1746564', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 2, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:OU6Ihb5iCvQC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '8972053037769588113', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"> <div class="gsh_csp">Indian herbal plant species <i>Lantana indica, Adhatoda vasica, Pandanus furcatus, Tylophora indica</i> and <i>Centella asiatica</i>, traditionally used in ethno medicines to treat common infections and various disorders, have been studied for their antimicrobial and antioxidant activity.

Second, the asymmetrical alignment of the arms and neck makes cropping them difficult. Third, despite a plethora of methods, removal of holes by surface approximation for this niche application remains a challenge particularly in obscure regions like the sides and armpits. This paper proposes a novel surface approximation method and incorporates it into an integrated procedure for pre-processing range scans of the torso that includes interactive tools for cropping stray points and extremities.

This paper proposes the architecture for a new generation mote that is needed in wireless sensor &amp; actuator networks (WSAN), with emphasis on semantically meaningful flexibility in operation. The first version of the mote coming out around May 07 would be fabricated by integrating off-the-shelf commercial components into a mote in order to test the functionality of the mote &amp; the SW. The second version expected around Dec 07, would be built around FPGA and RF transceiver chip. The functionality of the mote presented in this paper is derived from the concept and the features of Mote presented in the paper on DOMA by the authors [19]. Specifically it exhibits the capability of exploiting multiple protocols for communication, the capability to use semantic web, capability to self organize in the “ad-hoc” network environment, process considerable information in the mote itself based on the semantic needs, use specially designed real time operating system to suit the requirements of size and functionality, and much longer life time of the battery power. In order to meet the above processing requirements, the motes under development have, more processing power and address larger memory than the currently available motes and support the use of general-purpose sensors instead of the custom built sensors.</div></div>', 'author': 'Poonam Yadav and Anuragmayi Thuremella and Nagesh Yadav and A Kumar and D Kumar and PP Singh', 'eprint': 'https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/bitstream/10044/1/25108/2/WG200.pdf', 'publisher': 'IEEE/Macmillan advanced research series', 'title': 'Design of a flexible mote: fleximote', 'url': 'https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/handle/10044/1/25108', 'year': 2006}, 'citedby': 2, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:Dq1jD5C1HUoC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '6622940577175584543', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small">Scoliosis affects the alignment of the spine and the shape of the torso. Most scoliosis patients and their families are more concerned about the effect of scoliosis on the torso than its effect on the spine. There is a need to develop robust techniques for quantifying torso deformity based on full torso scans. In this paper, deformation indices obtained from orthogonal maps of full torso scans are used to quantify torso deformity in scoliosis. \'Orthogonal maps\' are obtained by applying orthogonal transforms to 3D surface maps. (An \'orthogonal transform\' maps a cylindrical coordinate system to a Cartesian coordinate system.) The technique was tested on 361 deformed computer models of the human torso and on 22 scans of volunteers (8 normal and 14 scoliosis). Deformation indices from the orthogonal maps correctly classified up to 95% of the volunteers with a specificity of 1.00 and a sensitivity of 0.91.

The Heat exchanger is divided into four parts according to its flow rates. The intermittent temperatures of the exchanger are estimated through network analysis. This analysis reveals that the heat exchanger is under performing according to the design specifications, such as flow rates of both the fluids and its inlet temperatures, and given surface geometry. The effectiveness of the exchanger is about 61%. The difference between design capacity, 780 kW, and actual heat dissipation rate, 48.02 kW, is due to lower air flow rates on both sides of the exchanger. To make use of the exchanger effectively, the flow rates of air should be properly supplied to meet the specified thermal capacity of the heat exchanger.

Pentobarbitone produces quick sleep latency (onset) and prolongation of total sleep time (duration). Sleep latency and total sleep time were used as a parameters for the evaluation. BR-16A potentiated the effect of triazolam  (0.1 mg/kg, ip) and alprazolam (0.25 mg/kg, ip). Melatonin (5 .0 mg/kg, ip) and zolpidem (0.5 mg/kg, ip) did not produce any significant effect on sleep parameters. However, alprazolam (0.25mg/kg, ip) potentiated the effect of BR-16A (100 mg/ kg, po) in higher dose only. Sleep promoting effect of BR-16A in combination with GABAergic drugs (triazolam and alprazolam,) suggested that these drugs have common mechanism in sleep promoting effect of pentobarbitone and could be used along with other GABAergic hypnotics for the treatment of insomnia.

We show that retail trades are systematically correlated-ie, individual investors buy (or sell) stocks in concert with each other.

Since we are interested in dynamic tasks and environments, a "planner within the feedback controller" approach is adopted. Trajectory generation for a particular dynamic behavior is shown to lead to several constraints in the state or control space. We use the concept of forward projection and preimages to generate these constraints. The trajectory is then planned using a dynamic constraint-generation and constraint-satisfaction framework. The lowest level motor controller behavior is altered by constraints generated by the constraint generation level on top. The solution to the resulting constrained problem, which is accomplished in real-time, automatically generates a desired dynamic behavior.&lt;&gt;</div></div>', 'author': 'Alok Kumar and Sunil K Singh', 'eprint': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel2/1070/7738/00325386.pdf', 'pages': '1252-1257', 'publisher': 'IEEE', 'title': 'Intelligent control of autonomous systems using a constrained optimal control approach', 'url': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/325386/', 'year': 1993}, 'citedby': 2, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:48xauSegjOkC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '7101730542153265305', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">The corrosion inhibitive efficiencies of substituted dithiomalonamides have been determined at different concentrations for 304 SS in H3PO4‐HC1 mixture at 25°C using potentiostatic technique.

Hard turning with the tool having wiper geometry possess these advantages over conventional turning process followed by grinding process. Hard turning is a primary metal cutting process which is extensively used for reduction of the diameter of workpiece to specified dimension and generation of smooth surface finish on the workpiece material having hardness greater than 45 HRC without supplementing it with grinding. Wiper geometry technology which is used for hard turning operation is made by carefully developed series of radii which make up the cutting edge.

Often, issues identified in past disaster response and relief efforts include lack of communication, delayed ordering of actions (eg, evacuations), and low levels of preparedness by authorities during disasters. A rapid response in the event of a disaster requires good situational awareness and fast sharing of that knowledge across the community. We believe that a digital ecosystem based on multimedia computing can address this major challenge in the society. The role of technology in disaster management is to connect, inform and ultimately save the lives of those impacted by disasters.

We validate this measure by showing that mutual funds that pay high dividends receive more inflows when the dividend sentiment is stronger. Further, we find that firms initiate or increase dividends when the dividend sentiment is stronger. These effects are concentrated among firms located in states with high dividend sentiment. Differences in risk or other firm characteristics do not explain our findings.

Waders are belonging to following families, viz. Ardeidae, Charadriidae, Recurvirostridae, Gruidae, Rallidae, Ciconidae, Jacanidae, Threskiornithidae and Burhinidae. Waders represent the greatest species diversity (Tak et al., 2003). Water birds and wetlands are inseparable elements (Grimmett &amp; Inskipp, 2007). Wetlands are the main custodians of the water birds (Weller, 1999; Stewart, 2001). Wetlands attract a large number of migratory and resident bird species. Wetlands are defined as transitional zone between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem where land is covered by shallow water (Mitsch &amp; Gosselink, 1986). They are also known as biological supermarkets because they provide extensive food chain and rich in biodiversity. Waders have been seen wading through the shallow waters and occasionally probing along dry margins of the wetland. They prefer shallow muddy banks of the pond and close by small water spots. The migratory waders need adequate food supply and safety</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Himanshu Mishra and Vikas Kumar and Ashish Kumar', 'eprint': 'http://www.biodiversityjournal.com/pdf/7(3)_331-336.pdf', 'title': 'Diversity and population status of waders (Aves) of Bakhira Tal, a natural wetland in District SantKabir Nagar, Uttar Pradesh, India', 'url': 'http://www.biodiversityjournal.com/pdf/7(3)_331-336.pdf', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 1, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:4xcnnZsK8tIC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '8933901147858036941', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">The present study reports the preparation of fruit fortified probiotic buttermilk (lassi) using Lactobacillus rhamnosus.

The discovery of green fluorescent protein (GFP) followed by elucidation of its molecular structure introduced a new and promising marker for biological studies. The diversity of currently available fluorescent proteins covers nearly the entire visible spectrum, providing numerous alternative possibilities for multicolor labeling and studies of protein interactions. This protein is intrinsically fluorescent, has a low toxicity, and allows easy imaging and quantification using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), confocal microscopy and epifluorescence microscopy which further expand the options for real time studies in living tissues.

The paper, considered two type of channel assignment (1) with guard channel (2) without guard channel. In cellular mobile system, radio channels are very limited and mobility of mobile terminal occurs a phenomenon called handoff. Handoff is defined as process of transferring an ongoing call or data session from one channel connected to the core network to another. Due to the limited bandwidth available in various cells, there is a finite probability that an ongoing call, while being handed off, or it may get dropped. Minimizing the dropping of ongoing call during the handoff is the important issue for the mobile communication. In this paper we analyzed the channel assignment by the Queueing approach and compared the result of both the models in terms of dropping and blocking probability. We used the MAHO scheme, mobile assisted handoff, in which mobile terminal assists BSS and mobile switching center makes handoff decisions. In MAHO mobile terminal required to reports its RSSI (received signal strength indication) back to its serving BSS. In first case we reserved some channels for handoff calls. And in 2nd case we didn’t use any guard channel; there is no priority in channel assignment for handoff.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Arun Kumar', 'eprint': 'https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/27a7/31578d30b303ef1dbedbec5d53c5d6f9204d.pdf', 'journal': 'International Journal of Scientific & Engineering Research', 'number': '7', 'title': 'Queuing analysis of combined guard channel and mobile assisted handoff on prioritized channel assignment for cellular network', 'url': 'https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/27a7/31578d30b303ef1dbedbec5d53c5d6f9204d.pdf', 'volume': '6', 'year': 2015}, 'citedby': 1, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:2Km5FFimHwEC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '17168387306802107859', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"> <div class="gsh_csp">Survival and growth of tiger shrimp (<i>Penaeus</i> <i>monodon</i>) at three salinity levels, 5, 10 and 15 g/L were investigated in potassium deficient natural inland saline water (PD-ISW) and potassium supplemented inland saline water (PS-ISW).

Serious cardiovascular complications have been seen in majority of individuals with early morning-surge in blood pressure. The floating-pulsatile concept can help to deliver the drug at definite place and time when symptoms of disease are more critical. The system consisted of three different parts, a core tablet, containing the active ingredient, an erodible outer shell and a top cover buoyant layer. The dry coated tablet consists in a drug-containing core, coated by a hydrophilic erodible polymer (HPMC E50 and lactose) which is responsible for a lag phase in the onset of pulsatile release. The buoyant layer, prepared with Methocel E50, Carbopol 934P and sodium bicarbonate, provides buoyancy to increase the retention of the oral dosage form in the stomach applied to increase the gastric residence of the dosage form having lag phase followed by a burst release. The developed formulations were evaluated for their buoyancy, in vitro dissolution and various other formulation factors. Results reveal that coating composition affects the lag time. Formulation containing Lactose as filler with 6.67% Crospovidone and coating composition using 30% lactose provide lag time of 4 h with 93.03% drug release in 6 h that shown a sigmoidal release pattern. These values were close to desired objective of producing lag time 4-5 h followed by fast drug release.

In this paper, three pre-retrieval query formulation strategies for heuristic retrieval in case of low obfuscated, high obfuscated, and translated text are studied. The strategies used are (a) Query formulation using proper nouns;(b) Query formulation using unique words (Hapax); and (c) Query formulation using most frequent words. Whereas in case of low and high obfuscation and simulated paraphrasing, keywords with Hapax proved to be slightly more efficient, initial results indicate that the simple strategy of query formulation using proper nouns gives promising results and may prove better in reducing the size of the corpus for post processing, for identifying local text reuse in case of obfuscated and translated text reuse.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Aarti Kumar and Sujoy Das', 'eprint': 'http://www.kpubs.org/article/articleDownload.kpubs?downType=pdf&articleANo=E1JSCH_2015_v3n1_24', 'journal': 'Journal of Information Science Theory and Practice (JISTaP) Volume', 'pages': '24-39', 'title': 'Query Formulation for Heuristic Retrieval in Obfuscated and Translated Partially Derived Text', 'url': 'http://www.kpubs.org/article/articleDownload.kpubs?downType=pdf&articleANo=E1JSCH_2015_v3n1_24', 'volume': '3', 'year': 2015}, 'citedby': 1, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:IK5eWejHrvwC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '15508421983066657030', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">This study examines how changes in firms\' information environment affect local agents.

The dendrogram analysis classified the isolates under study into 7 distinct types/clades with a discriminatory power (D value) of 0.83 and 0.82, respectively. With a maximum heterogeneity of 65%. Significant genetic similarity was observed between human and poultry (chicken, quail and poultry skin) isolates. This seems to be the first study from India on the application of ERIC-PCR for genotyping and detection of genetic diversity of Campylobacter spp. from different sources and origin. The common genotypes shared by poultry and human isolates reinforces the fact that poultry meat acts as the main source for human infection and hence effective control measures should be taken to control human infection during poultry meat processing.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'AAP Milton and RS Rathore and A Kumar', 'eprint': 'https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d7fd/154ded2fa733fe51c135eb1dacbeeddf99b3.pdf', 'journal': 'J.

Whole genome microarray, followed by biological pathway reconstruction, was used to investigate the host-microbe interactions at early (day 1) and later stages (day 7) of colonization. Both LA and LGG modulated common responses related to host metabolism, gut integrity, and immunity, as well as responses unique to each strain in pigs. Our data indicated that probiotic establishment and beneficial effects in the host are guided by:(1) down-regulation or upregulation of immune function-related genes in the early and later stages of colonization, respectively, and (2) alternations in metabolism of small molecules (vitamins and/or minerals) and macromolecules (carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids). Pathways related to immune modulation and carbohydrate metabolism were more affected by LGG, whereas energy and lipid metabolism-related transcriptome responses were prominently modulated by LA.

Based on the above observations it is proposed that sufficient electrical energy may be generated by harvesting contact electrification to energize not only LC based display devices but also current controlled devices, such as light emitting diodes, by employing suitable integrating technique.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'A Kumar and A Choudhary and A Saxena and APS Gahlot and G Berwal and V Upreti', 'eprint': 'http://journals.du.ac.in/ugresearch/pdf/J4.pdf', 'journal': 'DU Journal of Undergraduate Research and Innovation, Delhi University', 'title': 'Investigations on the triboelectric electricity generation and its application in energizing a voltage driven display device', 'url': 'http://journals.du.ac.in/ugresearch/pdf/J4.pdf', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 1, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:M8Ejg5y-C14C', 'id_scholarcitedby': '1543338286757062993', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp"><h3 class="gsh_h3">Objective:</h3><div class="gsh_csp"></div> The aim of this study is to assess the utilization of the pediatric risk of mortality-(PRISM)-III score to predict mortality in critically sick children and determination of mortality risk factors in a tertiary care pediatric unit. <h3 class="gsh_h3">Materials and Methods:</h3><div class="gsh_csp"></div> In this cross-sectional descriptive study, 100 children admitted during an 18-month period were enrolled in the study.

Such maps have been obtained by visual observations of the fluidisation interface in transparent fluidised beds. For beds which are visually inaccessible fluidisation maps are difficult to obtain. The present work therefore attempts to model the interface travel in a vacuum fluidised bed.

Chaotic systems are a particular type of complex dynamic systems, which could satisfactorily explain a wide range of phenomenon in many complex systems, including biological and physical. Such systems appears to follow a random behavior, but indeed are part of a deterministic process. Its random nature is given by their characteristic sensitivity to initial conditions that drives the system to unpredictable dynamics. However, in a chaotic system, this non-linear behavior is always limited by a higher deterministic structure. For this reason, there is always an underlying order in the apparent random dynamics. Chaotic systems are said to be mathematically deterministic because if the initial measurements were certain it would be possible to derive the end point of their trajectories. Contrary to classical mechanics, chaos theory deals with nonlinear feedback forces with multiple cause and effect relationships that can produce unexpected results. In such a situation, a chaotic system cannot be understood by the simple disintegration of the whole into smaller parts. A second feature that is often cited as typical of chaotic behavior of deterministic systems is the impossibility of predicting the future values of the variable (s) concerned (except possibly for the very near future). This might sound like a contradiction. This is where another important feature of chaos comes in, that is the presence of a strange attractor.

It gave straightforward guidelines that are to be followed whenever such a scenario arises in India which will be law until parliament passes legislation in this regard.

Migration of male labour force from Bihar has increased during last two decades which prompted us to analyze its consequences on efficiency of input in agricultural production, livelihood through remittances and also the empowerment of women left behind at place of origin. It was observed that the efficiencies of human labour and irrigation in rice production were higher than non-migrant households and statistically significant, indicating rational use of these two critical inputs on migrant households in Bihar.

In this paper, a comparative study is made on certain well-known and recently proposed proportional navigation guidance laws for intercepting high maneuvering targets. Performance of Augmented Ideal PNG, modified Augmented Ideal PNG and Angular Acceleration Guidance schemes are evaluated in an environment having non-holonomic wheeled mobile robots as interceptor and target. It is assumed that the trajectory and maneuvering capability of the target is unknown to the interceptor. Performance of methods based on different PNG laws are analyzed in terms of interception time and distance travelled. Simulation results show that AAG is the best among the three methods.

First, we evaluated the relationships between ENSO events and regional corn yield in the US Corn Belt, by taking data from 18 representative crop reporting districts for a 30 year period (1981-2010). These data were compiled as part of a large multiscale NIFA project titled U2U that aims at making Climate Information Useful to Usable. We clustered the data for different ENSO phases and performed statistical analysis to understand the impacts on corn yield.

During haulage operation tests were carried out onexisting seats used in Indian tractors with three new selected suspension systems of the two most selling models of MF 241 and MF 1035. The model MF 241 equipped with a existing seat is mostly used in India, while the model MF 1035 consists of exported benchmark seat (for comparison) which is a seat whose suspension appeared to majority of operators is used for more comfortable and rest three selected seat suspensions were replaced to same existing seat used in India. Tests were conducted with three different operators representing 5th, 50th and 95th percentile (SM1, SM2 and SM3) of the population of India. Best suspension system was selected, based on weighted RMS acceleration awx, awy, awz for each axis and the acceleration vector sum av performance. The values of weighted RMS acceleration awx, awy, awz, and acceleration vector sum av of different suspension systems were compared with exported benchmark seat as well as existing seat mostly used in India. The changes in the vibration peak along with speed were compared graphically. It was observed that the SP2 suspension gives better result amongthree selected suspensions.

Feature extraction transforms the raw speech signal into a compact but effective representation that is more stable and discriminative than the original signal. Since the front-end is the first component in the chain, the quality of the later components (speaker modeling and pattern matching) is strongly determined by the quality of the front-end. In other words, classification can be at most as accurate as the features. Several feature extraction methods have been proposed, and successfully exploited in the speaker recognition task.

Further, income hedging-induced demand predicts the future returns of value-minus-growth portfolios. The future aggregate value premium as well as the returns of state-level value-minusgrowth portfolios are higher when income hedging-induced demands are high.

Several of these complexes have been crystallized and their structures and functions characterized, while a much larger number of them (that may not crystallize) operate in the physiological system. Analyses of the known structures of proteinprotein complexes reveal that they form through interactions between specific patches on the surface of the component proteins. These patches, called interacting domains, are made from mostly non-contiguous residues in the protein sequence. Not all, but only a few of these residues called “hot spots”, contribute significantly to the binding free energy of these complexes. Interactions between the hot spot residues from two interacting domains control the thermodynamics and oligomeric states of the complexes. The hot spot residues have been targets for the design of small molecule agonists with medicinal applications. The interaction domains in protein-protein complexes vary in their contour, size, shape, complementarity and affinity. The number of interacting protomers in a complex can vary from 2 to&gt; 30. These complexes have been classified based on the 3-dimensional architecture, binding energies and lifetimes of these quaternary assemblies and the presence of symmetry in their structure. Protein-protein complexes have evolved to perform and regulate activities like signal transduction, metabolism, cell division and controlled cell death, in response to specific stimuli.

The purpose of this study was to explore thyroid system response to thyroid releasing hormone stimulation in persons with and without HIV infection and determine the extent to which their response was associated with depression. As part of a larger study of neuroendocrine response persons with HIV-1 infection, control and HIV-1 infected individuals were evaluated. Participants’ response to TRH stimulation was evaluated via TSH, total T3, and T4 levels at baseline and 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes after TRH stimulation. Participants with HIV infection had a more robust response to TRH stimulation as measured by higher levels of TSH, lower levels of T4 and modestly higher levels of T3. Depressed persons had a reduced TSH response to stimulation and lower levels of both T4 and T3, although the effect of depression on T4 was not statistically significant. These results suggest that TSH response to TRH-stimulation may be exaggerated in individuals with HIV infection but reduced in those with depression. They also suggest that the effects of depression and HIV infection may interact, and may provide a partial explanation for observed thyroid abnormalities in HIV-infected individuals. Results thus provide a partial explanation for findings on thyroid and depression in those affected by HIV infection.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Raymond L Ownby and Drenna Waldrop-Valverde and Adarsh Kumar and Mahendra Kumar', 'eprint': 'http://file.scirp.org/pdf/WJA20120400002_71459696.pdf', 'journal': 'World Journal of AIDS', 'number': '04', 'pages': '279', 'publisher': 'Scientific Research Publishing', 'title': 'Thyroid function and depression in HIV-1 infection', 'url': 'http://file.scirp.org/pdf/WJA20120400002_71459696.pdf', 'volume': '2', 'year': 2012}, 'citedby': 1, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:TPlbvKeUp3cC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '6198092908184293579', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Thls thesis entrtled STUDIES ON HYPERBRANCHED POLYMERS descnbes the synthesis and charactemtion of two classes of hyperbranched polymers namely hyperbranched polyurethanes and hyperbranched polyesters These mvvesbgabons were undertaken wth the objeave of probmg the effect of vanahon of molecular structural parameters such as (a) spacer length bet- branchng junctrons (b) reversal of terminal funcaonal groups (c) 111corporabon of a mesogemc urut by copolymenzatmn and (d) vanabon of branclung density m lightly branched mam cham thermotmpic lquld crystallme polymers</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Anil Kumar', 'title': 'Studies On Hyperbranched Polymers', 'url': 'http://etd.iisc.ac.in/static/etd/abstracts/2385/G14797-Abs.pdf', 'year': 2012}, 'citedby': 1, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:ByB5RH_0zRoC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '423729030072551850', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">The aim of image enhancement is to improve the perception of information in images for human viewers, or to providebetter\'input for other automated image processing techniques.

The ZVZCS means mixed operation of zero-voltage switching (ZVS) for leading-leg switches and zero-current switching (ZCS) for lagging-leg switches. The primary side of the converter is composed of FB insulated-gate bipolar transistors, which are driven by phase-shift control. The secondary side is composed of a resonant tank and a halfwave rectifier. Without an auxiliary circuit, zero-voltage switching (for leading-leg switches) and zero-current switching (for lagging-leg switches) are achieved in the entire operating range.

An evaluation of these studies done throughout the world clearly indicates that potted-plants can provide an efficient, self-regulating, low-cost, sustainable, bioremediation system for indoor air pollution, which can effectively compliment engineering measures to reduce indoor air pollution, and hence improve human wellbeing and productivity.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'AS Pipal and A Kumar and R Jan and A Taneja', 'eprint': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Megha_Jha/publication/259194704_In_Vitro_Antioxidant_and_Cytotoxicity_Assay_of_Pistia_Stratiotes_L_Against_B16F1_and_B16F10_Melanoma_Cell_Lines/links/0deec52a5d3aa79b5f000000/In-Vitro-Antioxidant-and-Cytotoxicity-Assay-of-Pistia-Stratiotes-L-Against-B16F1-and-B16F10-Melanoma-Cell-Lines.pdf#page=337', 'pages': '319-321', 'publisher': 'Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg', 'title': 'Role of plants in removing indoor air pollutants', 'url': 'https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-23394-4_67', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 1, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:FnaCo-ypupUC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '8051151946136414631', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">The paper is based on the optimal design of pipe networks for the water distribution. The treated water has to be supplied to the consumers in their individual homes. This function of carrying water is accomplished through well planned distribution system with optimal design of pipes as it comprises the major investment in the system. So for economy and cutting down huge expenditures, design of water distribution networks has to be such that the cost incurred is minimal and simultaneously it meets the demands and discharges at various outlets of the network. The problem in this paper has thus been solved with a view to reduce the cost of pipe networking with the required amount discharge in the outlet, Hardy Cross Method has been used for estimating the required discharge in each outlet of the pipe network, and optimization of the system has been done to reduce the cost with the help of Microsoft-excel. The proposed optimization setup has been very close to the original value, thereby validating its use for optimization.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Briti Sundar Sil and Ajeet Kumar and Pallavi Saikia and P Jarken Bui and Preetam Banerjee', 'eprint': 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.411.8874&rep=rep1&type=pdf', 'journal': 'International Journal of Computational Engineering Research', 'number': '2', 'pages': '137-142', 'title': 'Computation of least cost pipe network–an alternate method', 'url': 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.411.8874&rep=rep1&type=pdf', 'volume': '3', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 1, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:5thYEm8kiqcC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '10043436445993662761', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"> <div class="gsh_csp">TiO<sub>2</sub> is the most commonly used photo catalyst because of its high oxidation power, stability and non toxicity.

Method A is based on the formation of yellow colored charge transfer complex between doxofylline as n-donor and iodine as σ-acceptor. Method B is based on the reaction of doxofylline with iron (III) and subsequent reaction with α, α’-bipyridyl in an acid medium to yield a red colored complex.

In addition, biomass and sugar yield components were analyzed: plant stand, stalk yield, stripped stalk yield, bagasse yield, juice volume and weight, brix, total sugar, sugar yield. Other characters like seedling vigor, standing ability, plant uniformity, head type, grain color, insect and disease resistance were also studied. Uniform and precise results of the field trials was noted for biomass and juice yield. Sugar content was very variable across entries and test environments. Biomass and juice yield, major components of sugar yield showed a very strong correlation to sugar content. Thus, selection was reliably made in terms of juice yield leads to the identification of six hybrids being the most promising ones: ICSA502 x ICSV700, ICSV511 x ICSV700, ICSV702 x SSV74, ICSA502 x SPV422, ICSA502 x SSV74 and ICSA675 x ICSV700.

The restorer lines of the selected hybrids, ICSV700 and SPV422 suggest the importance of additive gene action in complementing the dominant gene action apparent in the vigor of these hybrids.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'AM Salazar and JAM Tarun and JC Punzalan and AKM Beltran and CB Pascual and M Caasi-Lit and PJA Santos and CE Reano and B Reddy and A Kumar', 'journal': 'Philippine Journal of Crop Science (Philippines)', 'title': 'Sweet sorghum hybrid parents improvement for bioethanol production for sustainable energy security in the Philippines', 'url': 'http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=PH2013000599', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 1, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:njwWRc9PkvUC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '9892957390101607815', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'author': 'Amit Kumar', 'journal': 'Indian Veterinary Journal', 'number': '2', 'pages': '79', 'title': 'Congenital goiter in kids due to feeding of Brassicaceae plants', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6652702621433153159&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'volume': '88', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 1, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:GGgVawPscysC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '6652702621433153159', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'author': 'Alexandra Zelaski and Timothy R Garcia and Ashutosh Kumar and Thomas E Blue and Wolfgang Windl', 'journal': 'Transactions of the American Nuclear Society', 'pages': '69', 'title': 'Development of 4H-SiC Schottky diode detector for nuclear fuel reprocessing applications', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16301295724885747088&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'volume': '104', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 1, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:8VbLR7ExW8oC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '16301295724885747088', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">The world is shrinking and one such reason for it is the mobile technology. With the increase in mobiles even the number of nodes in the Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) has to be increased. The MANETs are dynamic in nature and this initiates issues in determining the best possible route for the packets. Moreover the packets may face excess traffic and congestion in the network which degrade the performance of overall network and making the scenario worst these problems even lead to packet losses. Although several protocols have already been designed to discuss over these issues we still try to propose a new routing protocol which combines the properties of both static and dynamic routing protocol and thereafter tries to eliminate the problems inherent in the network through density based routing. Our research mainly focuses on the average traffic of the network and after analysing it the packet is given a path from source to destination which is less congested. At the end we find an improved protocol which not only reduces the packet losses occurring because of congestion and overloading but also which is less vulnerable to problems and is more adaptable to changing situations.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Shiv Shakti Srivastava and Babu Ram and Aditya Kumar', 'title': 'Minimization of the Packet Losses in MANETS base od both Static and Dynamic Routing Protocols', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=653785758036936336&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 1, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:KPAPMsW7zc0C', 'id_scholarcitedby': '653785758036936336', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">In the present experiment the fresh water fish Cirrhinus mrigala cirrhinus mrigala Subject Category: Organism Names</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Kumar Anand and VP Sabhlok', 'journal': 'Environment and Ecology', 'number': '1', 'pages': '238-241', 'publisher': 'MKK Publication', 'title': 'Effect of heavy metals on physical and behavioral characteristics of fresh water fish (Cirrhinus mrigala).', 'url': 'https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20113121831', 'volume': '29', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 1, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:1l3MdapXzAoC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '13676041485394224954', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">The efficiency of banking system is very important for the growth of the overall economy of a country. This is because of the reason that sound banking system serves as an important medium for accomplishing economic growth through the mobilisation of fiscal savings and putting them to the productive use. Given the socioeconomic implications of the banking sector the analyses of relative efficiency of banks has gained popularity among people from banking sector, policy makers, researchers and academicians and other interested parties. This paper is an attempt to investigate the efficiency of Indian commercial banks with the help of data envelopment analysis (DEA), a deterministic nonparametric approach. DEA was firstly applied by Sherman and Gold (1985) for assessing the efficiency of banks. It is a very promising tool for measuring the efficiency of banks (Berger and Humphrey, 1997). DEA is a preferred econometric approach of measuring efficiency because of its advantages over other techniques. The results of this study show that only 5 and 17 banks are efficient on the criteria of technical efficiency and pure technical efficiency respectively. Further ANOVA test indicates that there is no significant difference in the mean technical efficiency scores of various banks belonging to various groups defined for the purpose of this study.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Ashish Kumar', 'eprint': 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.454.6268&rep=rep1&type=pdf', 'journal': 'International Journal of Computer Science and Management Studies', 'number': '03', 'title': 'Analysis of Efficiency of Banks in a Developing Economy: A case of India', 'url': 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.454.6268&rep=rep1&type=pdf', 'volume': '2', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 1, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:wbdj-CoPYUoC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '16011875773470323865', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Radiotracer technique has been used to study the removal behavior of Hg (II) ions from aqueous solutions by synthesized and well characterized hydrous ferric oxide (HFO) and hydrous tungsten oxide (HTO).

Using individual-level political contributions of analysts as a proxy for their political preferences, we find that conservative Republican analysts issue more conservative forecasts, especially when market-wide or firm-specific uncertainty levels are high. Those analysts are less likely to be bold and they exhibit weaker over-reaction to favorable private information. Further, although Republican analysts issue more timely forecasts, they favor frequent small revisions over few large revisions. Overall, Republican analysts issue more accurate forecasts, where their forecast accuracy is higher for firms with Republican CEOs and when the Republican party is in power. Sophisticated market participants are aware of the superior abilities of Republican analysts as they receive greater media coverage and are more likely to be voted to all-star analyst teams. However, less sophisticated retail investors are unable to identify the positive relation between political conservatism and forecast accuracy. The market reaction to forecast revisions by Republican analysts is weaker, particularly among stocks that are more actively traded by retail investors. Taken together, these results indicate that personal political orientation of analysts affects the quality of their earnings forecasts and the speed of information dissemination in financial markets.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Danling Jiang and Alok Kumar and Kelvin Law', 'publisher': 'Working paper, University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL', 'title': 'Do political preferences of equity analysts affect earnings forecasts and market prices', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14834785010064357586&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'year': 2010}, 'citedby': 1, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:ns9cj8rnVeAC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '14834785010064357586', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Studies were conducted to observe the effect of heat shrinkable films on shelf life and quality of kiwifruit maintained under ambient conditions.

We find that firms with high local institutional ownership are more profitable, less risky, and have better internal governance. Those firms are less likely to engage in undesirable corporate activities such as aggressive earnings management or option back-dating and are less likely to be target of class action lawsuits. Total and option-based executive compensation levels are also lower for firms with more local institutional shareholders. Further, monitoring activities of local institutions are more effective when there is a higher local concentration of longer-term, dedicated investors. In contrast, local monitoring is less effective when external governance mechanisms are strong (ie, GIM index is low and takeover probability is high) or when firms have better governance because they are located in highly religious areas. Thus, local monitoring acts as a substitute for other forms of governance. Taken together, these results are consistent with our conjecture that local institutions are more effective monitors of corporate behavior because monitoring costs vary inversely with distance.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Vidhi Chhaochharia and Alok Kumar and Alexandra Niessen-Ruenzi', 'eprint': 'https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d074/b45296a3da82977dfa5c05bb8d1bbf9e39f0.pdf', 'journal': 'Shareholder Proximity and Corporate Policies (March, 12 2010)', 'title': 'Distance Matters!

This paper presents a new blind CFO estimation scheme for single-input single-output (SISO) OFDM systems. The presented scheme is based on the assumption that the channel frequency response changes slowly in frequency domain.

In this mass region, as the proton Fermi surface lies near the bottom of the πh11/2 sub-shell and the neutron Fermi surface lies near the top of the νh11/2 subshell, the rotational alignment of a pair of proton from the lower h11/2 mid-shell drives the nucleus to a near prolate (γ~ 0º) shape while the rotational alignment of a pair of h11/2 neutron from the upper mid-shell drives the nucleus to near oblate shape (γ~ 60º). Thus the different excitation of quasiparticles may drive the nucleus to form different shapes and shape coexistence has been observed in this mass region. A particularly interesting scenario occurs when the occupation of shapedriving orbital at the Fermi surface removes axial symmetry and forces the nucleus to addopt a triaxial shape. Interesting feature of this mass region is the existence of regular M1 bands which have been considered to be a promising candidates of magnetic rotation. In several nuclei of the A~ 130 mass region M1 bands [1] are known.

The aim of this procedure is to obtain 3D images that can be used for assessment of external spinal deformities in scoliosis. Scoliosis is a condition characterized by lateral deviation of the spine coupled with rotation of individual vertebra resulting in visible torso asymmetries. The procedure provides clinicians with a cost effective and mobile setup of acquiring 3D images. To improve the registration process, a novel approach combining tree weighted colour based image segmentation and differential geometry was developed. Image reconstruction involved pre-processing, triangulation and texture application to obtain a 3D image. Analysis was performed using human subjects and objects of known dimension. Evaluation of system performance was done against existing stereovision procedures and range scanning systems. The final 3D image was compared to that obtained from the Konica Minolta Vivid 700 laser scanner. Each image was divided into 360 cross sections for evaluation against size and shape. The 3D image reconstructed from this novel procedure was 75–100% accurate when compared against the 3D image from the laser scanner. The results demonstrate that the procedure is a cost effective clinical tool for assessing torso shape and symmetry.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'A Kumar and N Durdle', 'eprint': 'https://www.witpress.com/Secure/elibrary/papers/BIO09/BIO09024FU1.pdf', 'journal': 'WIT Transactions on Biomedicine and Health', 'number': '1', 'pages': '257-266', 'title': 'A novel 3D torso image reconstruction procedure using a pair of digital stereo back images', 'url': 'http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=cNeWylqevOIC&oi=fnd&pg=PA257&dq=info:wBCACEJePxcJ:scholar.google.com&ots=oTns-OkO5y&sig=OPXm2i-PKs8k4bkaIUT_woOp8qI', 'volume': '13', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 1, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:Lyl8M50Wyb0C', 'id_scholarcitedby': '1675161224108576960', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">In this study, three different distribution planning Supply Chain (SC) models for multilevel supply chain designs are considered.

Some of the RET techniques used involves the use of OPC, PSM and hard mask. In order to reduce the costs it is desirable to have uniform performance on shuttle masks, which can help to reduce manufacturing costs. The micro loading and macro loading are of concern to mask makers because of the varying loads being etched within the mask. It is critical to have a mask etcher that provides excellent CD uniformity, CD bias, CD linearity and etch profile in order to have image fidelity of the OPC structures as well as sustainable yields. This paper discusses micro and macro loading challenges on BIM and APSM masks and the advantages of using the Applied Materials\' next generation mask etcher.</div></div>', 'author': 'M Chandrachood and TYB Leung and K Yu and M Grimbergen and S Panayil and I Ibrahim and A Sabharwal and A Kumar', 'eprint': 'https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/6792/67920S/Overcoming-mask-etch-challenges-for-45-nm-and-beyond/10.1117/12.798810.pdf', 'pages': '1-10', 'publisher': 'VDE', 'title': 'Overcoming Mask Etch Challenges for 45 nm & Beyond', 'url': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5755032/', 'year': 2008}, 'citedby': 1, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:-w1eE4La9_EC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '13943940078745915346', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small">Fours sets of PM10 samples were collected in three sites in SEQ from December 2002 to August 2004.

Half of the samples were used in this study for the analysis of water-soluble ions, which are Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, NH4 +, Cl-, NO3 -, SO4 2-, F-, Br-, NO2 -, PO4 -3 and the other half was retained by QLD EPA. The fourth set of samples was collected at Rocklea, specifically for this study. A quarter of the samples obtained from this set of samples were used to analyse water-soluble ions; a quarter of the sample was used to analyse Pb, Cu, Al, Fe, Mn and Zn; and the rests were used to analyse US EPA 16 priority PAHs. The water-soluble ions were extracted ultrasonically with water and the major watersoluble anions as well as NH4 + were analysed using IC. Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+ Pb, Cu, Al, Fe, Mn and Zn were analysed using ICP-AES while PAHs were extracted by acetonitrile and analysed using HPLC.

It does so by a novel approach combining color based image segmentation and differential geometry. It involves three stages: image segmentation, adaptive local pixel matching, and deferential geometry in a tree weighted belief propagation procedure. The registration was compared to 2 existing registration procedures, segment-based adaptive belief propagation (adaptive BP) and color-weighted hierarchical belief propagation (hierarchical BP). A 3D scan of a mannequin was obtained and errors in reconstruction were measured for each of the 360 cross sections of the mannequin. The proposed procedure outperforms existing methods, particularly for high curvature regions and significantly large cross sections. Its accuracy of reconstruction ranged from 85-100% compared to 75-100% for other existing methods. It was 35% to 40% faster. This work provides a solution to the registration problem and is an important step in developing a cost effective technique for measuring torso shape and symmetry of scoliosis patients using stereo digital cameras.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'A Kumar and N Durdle and J Raso', 'journal': 'Studies in health technology and informatics', 'pages': '161-165', 'title': 'A novel solution for registration of stereo digital torso images of scoliosis patients.', 'url': 'https://europepmc.org/abstract/med/18810020', 'volume': '140', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 1, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:7bRg-L-9LFcC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '3328958737421420327', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">This paper provides details on the design, manufacturing, analysis, testing, and deployment of cross-haul buckets used for the pick up, cross haul, and hang off installation of the Independence Hub Steel Catenary Risers in MC 920 in 8000 feet of water depth.

For instance, industry observers (eg, Fites 1996) have noted how firms like Caterpillar rely on their superior reputations to earn the support of their trading partners. However, as Kirmani and Rao (2000) lament, despite its apparent importance, the reputation construct has received scant attention from marketing scholars. As such, specific theoretical and empirical accounts for the role of firm reputations in B2B exchange are virtually non-existent. The current dissertation purports to fill this gap, as described below. A key question addressed by this dissertation deals with a reputation\'s role in inter-firm relationships. I outline complex, two-pronged influence of reputations in exchange. Specifically, I argue that on one hand, a firm\'s favorable reputation can produce specific partner incentives, such as price premiums, which can motivate relationship maintenance by the partners. lntriguingly, however, a favorable reputation may also have an opposite effect of reducing partner cooperation. Specifically, a firm\'s reputation represents a valuable asset (Barney 1991) which may be surreptitiously exploited by partners, for instance through product diversions to unauthorized distribution outlets. Collectively, these arguments suggest that the partner\'s actual behavior (ie, cooperation or not) maybe determined jointly by these two opposite effects of reputation. In turn, this has coordination implications, because it may impact the need for formal (and costly) relationship mechanisms in the focal relationship. My second research question deals with different …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Alok Kumar', 'publisher': 'University of Wisconsin--Madison', 'title': 'Some pain, some gain: the role of reputations in governing interfirm relationships', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14616975515818684399&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 1, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:Y5dfb0dijaUC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '14616975515818684399', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">This study examines whether gender and minority status of sell-side analysts influences their forecasting style, accuracy, and markets’ perceptions of their abilities.

Further, both female and minority analysts utilize their private information sub-optimally, where the degree of inefficiency is greater among minority analysts. As a result, female analysts have greater forecast accuracy, while minority analysts are less accurate. In spite of these style and accuracy differences, markets have favorable opinions about the abilities of both groups.

However, in most of the previous publications on Hybrid Orientation Technology (HOT), nFETs were fabricated on silicon-on-insulator (SOI), but pFETs were bulk-like.

So providing a language support for application development in open systems is vital. Component-oriented programming is well suited for open systems [1]. The component interactions is the key issue in composition languages. Software systems can be viewed in two distinct ways. A running system can be seen as a collection of interacting entities. However, at the level of system specification we can view the system as a composition of various software components [1].

Due to high importance of export of fisheries sector, it is important to analyze its performance and the factors affecting the same. There is concern about impact of WTO and trade liberalization measures on export performance and competitiveness and how the fisheries sector will respond to a free market economy and liberal trade regime. Further, traditional barriers such as tariffs and quantitative restrictions, have been substantiall) liberalized through the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and more recently the World Trade Organization (WTO). However, food safety issues, quality and composition standards, labeling requirements, etc. for trade in fisheries commodities are becoming important (Dey et al 2004). In fact in recent years, SPS issues in the fisheries sector have become major trade policy issues, and a source of considerable international friction and dispute. But these issues and their implications over the fisheries sector in India are not well understood.

Because of the conditional heteroscedasticity in the series, we carried out ARFIMA-GARCH procedures to check whether long persistence were robust in the presence of conditional heteroskedasticity.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Alok Kumar', 'eprint': 'http://fmwww.bc.edu/repec/esFEAM04/up.22776.1082012218.pdf', 'number': '783', 'publisher': 'Econometric Society', 'title': 'Time Series Behaviour of Stock Trading Volume: An Evidence from Indian Stock Market', 'url': 'http://fmwww.bc.edu/repec/esFEAM04/up.22776.1082012218.pdf', 'year': 2004}, 'citedby': 1, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:tS2w5q8j5-wC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '14268319954901185006', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">This paper is an attempt to investigate the pollution level of the river Mahananda at Jhaua for some physico-chemical parameters like temperature, pH, alkalinity, heavy metals, total hardness, etc. The results show significant variation in these parameters but the pollutional level of the water is minimum at Jhaua.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Krishna Deo Jha and NN Jha and A Kumar and JK Yadav', 'journal': 'Asian Journal of Chemistry', 'number': '2', 'pages': '1237', 'publisher': 'Asian Journal of Chemistry', 'title': 'Studies on Physico-chemical Characteristics of Lentic and Lotic Water Bodies of River Mahananda at Jhaua, Katihar (Bihar)', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6145164625861150969&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'volume': '16', 'year': 2004}, 'citedby': 1, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:1pC5hbHeJ6IC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '6145164625861150969', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">This study documents the existence of a common component in the buy-sell activities of retail investors, and evaluates its impact on US stock returns.

We find that the buy/sell decisions of retail investors are correlated in a manner orthogonal to market movements; and that a risk factor based on this directional behavior helps to explain returns, particularly for small, low priced, low-institutionally owned, and value stocks.

Furthermore their purity has been ascertained by TLC resolution studies (xylene-ethylacetoacetate, 7:3). Structure of all the synthesized compounds have been established on the basis of their consistent elemental, IR and NMR spectral data. The comprehensive study of electrochemical behaviour of all the  synthesized compounds has been studied over a wide <i>p</i>H range. It gives diffusion-controlled, irreversible and single two electron wave corresponding to the reduction of -N=N- moiety. On the basis of d.c. polarography and cyclic voltammetry, a reaction mechanism is suggested. The kinetic parameters i.e., charge transfer coefficient (αn) and forward rate constant (<i>k°</i><sub>f,h</sub>)<i> </i>have been calculated. The effect of ionic strength has also been studied.

The phenyl groups, departing much from regular hexagonal shape, adopt highly skewed conformations with respect to the plane constituted by the four central atoms.

The result is a dialogue through different topics of mechanics, sometimes dwelling on a minor confusion, other times discussing a major conceptual hurdle. The teacher tries to explain with restraint, and judiciously leaves a point when further going might be too technical or advanced. We believe readers who share the student\'s doubts on this or that point in introductory mechanics will find the dialogue useful, and gain some fresh clarifications and insights.

Metal pollution in soil and coastal water has been reported in many parts of India.

The mechanism of the complexation was investigated by spectroscopy absorption and the rate constants and the quantum yield determined. Rate constants and quantum yields for the formation of the final products were found to depend on pH, ligand, and metal cyanide concentration. The values are a maximum at pH 7.4. At pH &gt;7.4 the reverse reaction, generating octacyanomolybdate complex from the heptacyano species, is faster. At low pH, the ligand is protonated and less reactive; hence, the rate of reaction and quantum yield values decrease. The ionic strength does not affect the reaction rate, implying an associative mechanism for the photochemical reaction with dien, supported by the rate law. The observed rate law is:      <div class="gsh_dspfr"><svg aria-label="k_{\\rm {obs.}}={k_{2}k_{4}{\\rm I}_{a}{\\rm{[OH^{-}]}}{\\rm{[ dien]}} \\over 1+ k_{2}{\\rm [OH^{-}]}}" class="gs_fsvg"

km from Narora Atomic Power Station site for the years 1990-97.

The paper is somewhat premature in the sense that though the material as a mineral has been known for a long time, very little is known about pure single crystal ilmenite and hence few applications have been demonstrated. Yet, in another sense, it is very timely due to the fact that ilmenite promises to be a very interesting competition to silicon, silicon carbide and other compound semiconductors, especially those that are employed in high power, high temperature and large data storage/retrieval applications. It seems to be an excellent example of a small investment-high return situation. While some of the applications of this material-for production of oxygen, for instance-have been well-known, electronic applications have received relatively little attention. One reason for this was the fact that growth of single crystal ilmenite requires precise process conditions and parameters.

Starting from an exact general definition of the above waiting time distribution for random walks in the actual disordered medium, the corresponding first hop waiting time distribution for the CTRW on a lattice is shown to coincide with the distribution of waiting times between consecutive hops, as assumed originally by Scher and Lax. The authors\' analysis thus supports the correctness of the Scher and Lax theory of AC conductivity of disordered systems. The relation between the random walk equation for hopping in a random medium proposed by Scher and Lax and the more familiar rate equations for site-occupancy probabilities is also established.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'AA Kumar and J Heinrichs', 'journal': 'Journal of Physics C: Solid State Physics', 'number': '11', 'pages': '2131', 'publisher': 'IOP Publishing', 'title': 'Random walks and AC conductivity of disordered systems', 'url': 'https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0022-3719/13/11/012/meta', 'volume': '13', 'year': 1980}, 'citedby': 1, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:Ei5r6KrKXVQC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '14709926897754954059', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'author': 'Arun Kumar and P Kumar', 'journal': 'Indian journal of botany', 'title': 'Relationship between chlorophyll content and dry matter production in grassland communities at Pilani, Rajasthan', 'url': 'http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201301326029', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 1, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:8BwKzHq_VgYC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '8167465627359840606', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr">1.

Despite efforts to speed up training only 1251 midwives have been trained in Uttar Pradesh under the program.  In response to this problem the Population Centre is currently implementing 3 pilot programs aimed at increasing the involvement of midwives in the provision of maternal and child health care services in Uttar Pradesh.  These programs will be evaluated in June and July of 1977 and the programs will be compared in terms of cost effectiveness.  The first programs goal is to replenish the delivery kits of 650 previously trained midwives.  Following the distribution of the kits the program will be valuated in terms of 1) the number of kits actually delivered; 2) the degree to which the replenished kits were used; and 3) the level of midwife satisfaction with the kits.  In the 2nd program midwives receive training at the sub-centers of 2 Public Health Centers.  Training lasts for 9 months.  During this time the midwives attend lectures at the sub-center twice a week and provide maternal services to their usual clientele under the supervision of an auxiliary nurse midwife.  This program will be evaluated in regard to 1) cost effectiveness; 2) extent of services provided by the midwives; and 3) the number of family planning acceptors motivated by the midwives.

When an unpolished surface is magnified thousands of times, it usually looks like mountains and valleys. By repeated abrasion, those" mountains" are worn down until they are flat or just small" hills." The process of polishing with abrasives starts with coarse ones and graduates to fine ones. The surface of a metallographic specimen is prepared by various methods of grinding, polishing, and etching. After preparation, it is often analyzed using optical or electron microscopy. The process of polishing is divided into rough polishing and fine polishing. The wet grinding machine is used for rough polishing in which we use different grade emery papers. In an industry, making the surface of the material fine and polished is done using highly sophisticated and automatic surface polishing machines which uses abrasive belts rolling over the metallic rollers and the job is being done on it. In our project we have to fabricate a wet grinding (surface polishing) Machine and test its effectiveness also.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Bhaskar Chandra Kandpal and Rajesh Kumar Verma and Dalip Malhotra and Ashish Kumar and Anuj Kumar and Mallika Taneja', 'eprint': 'https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7a64/d62fb09009df8eed758a1b2748f9b0c11e06.pdf', 'title': 'Fabrication of wet grinding machine and measure the metal removal rate using different grades emery paper', 'url': 'https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7a64/d62fb09009df8eed758a1b2748f9b0c11e06.pdf'}, 'citedby': 1, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:f9jR0vFhilIC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '741667623700464327', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">One of the frequently used IC in bio-medical instruments for multiplexing the various signals is Analog multiplexer.

CSR is a sustainable process which helps balance the three levels of sustainable development-financial growth, Environmental protection and Social development. Under the new Companies Act, 2013, passed by Parliament in August 2013, Companies with net worth over 500 crores or turnover of over 1000 crores or net profit of 5 crores, two per cent of average profit of previous three years needs to be spent for social cause. In this context the present paper examines the corporate social responsibility spending of the Indian oil company ie Oil India Limited. The study also focused on the various initiatives by OIL as a part of its social responsibility in rural India and Assam in particular. The investments seen from the study are in natural resource management, improving the economic conditions, capacity building, empowerment of disables and rural development on sustained basis. The study is based on the secondary data collected from annual reports of the companies. The findings can assist the policy makers to ensure that the Indian companies increased their Corporate Social Responsibility spending.

It is grown for its oil and edible nuts and is a crop of worldwide significance. Plants are small, usually erect, and thin stemmed with featherlike leaves grown by both marginal and large commercial producers. The leaves are arranged in alternate pairs. It produces yellow, orange, cream, or white flowers, which produces “pegs” (developing fruit). Pegs mature into the ground to grow the pod.

Ongoing work in the Wilkinson laboratory aimed at identifying novel agents that target Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of African trypanosomiasis, identified several prodrugs that once activated form ICLs in this protozoan parasite. To understand the complexity of ICL repair systems that T. brucei employs to resolve such damage, a variety of null mutant lines were generated that lack activities postulated to fix such lesions. Phenotypic screens using various DNA damaging agents revealed that TbMRE11, TbEXO1, TbCSB, TbCHL1, TbFAN1, TbBRCA2 and TbRAD51 all help to resolve ICLs, implicating components of the homologous recombination, nucleotide excision repair and mismatch repair pathways in resolving this form of damage: This approach demonstrated that components of the translesion synthesis pathway (TbREV2 and TbREV3) do not play a significant role in ICL repair. In many organisms, nucleases belonging to the SNM1/PSO2 family play a key and specific role in the repair of ICLs with this property extending to the T. brucei homologue, TbSNM1. To assess whether there is a functional linkage between the DNA repair factors noted above and TbSNM1, a series of double null mutants were constructed and the susceptibility of these lines to ICL inducing agents determined. Identification of their epistatic/non-epistatic interactions revealed that T. brucei expresses at least two ICL repair systems with one pathway involving the concerted activities of TbSNM1/TbCSB …</div></div>', 'author': 'Ambika Kumar', 'eprint': 'http://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/36675/Kumar_A_PhD_final_190418.pdf?sequence=1', 'title': 'DNA Interstrand Crosslink Repair in Trypanosoma brucei', 'url': 'http://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/123456789/36675', 'year': 2018}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:c9MN4jr3zw0C', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Normal physiology is maintained under ideal environmental conditions.

However, we contend that other cost factors such as loss due to the number of en route truck stoppages based on a truck type and recovery cost associated with a route choice decision, should also be considered for deciding the fleet mix and minimizing the overall costs for long-haul shipments. The resulting non-linear model, with integer variables for the number and type of trucks, and the route choices, is solved via genetic algorithm. Using real data from a bulk liquid hazmat transporter, the trade-offs between the cost of travel, loss due to number of truck stoppages, and the long-term recovery cost associated with the risk of exposure due to a hazmat carrier accident are discussed.

Distinction among the tumours may, in part depend on the embryologic stage of initiation and the histologic and gross appearance of the lesion at the age of clinical discovery. Ameloblastomas are known to occur at unusual locations, metastasize, or transform into malignant neoplasms. They may show various biologic behaviours, ranging from cystic expansion to more aggressive infiltration of adjacent tissue. Ameloblastomas have a wide variation in clinical presentation, histology and prognosis, and they are also known for late recurrences, significant local morbidity and systemic spread. Though many advances are being made in the diagnosis and management of this tumour, there always has existed an air of debate and controversy on the very nature and management of this tumour. Various authors have different viewpoints regarding the nature of this tumour due to its myriad presentations. Newer treatment modalities have been tried over the years to prevent recurrence, reduce morbidity and facilitate adequate rehabilitation in patients affected with ameloblastoma.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Anshuman Kumar and Aviral Verma and Apala Baduni and Navneet Kaur', 'eprint': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Aviral_Verma5/publication/315528236_Ameloblastoma_and_its_Malignant_Transformation_Treatment_Ladder_Related_Syndromes_and_Controversies/links/58d3c8c2a6fdccd24d460d1f/Ameloblastoma-and-its-Malignant-Transformation-Treatment-Ladder-Related-Syndromes-and-Controversies.pdf', 'journal': 'Journal of Contemporary Medical Research', 'number': '2', 'pages': '561-564', 'title': 'Ameloblastoma and its Malignant Transformation: Treatment Ladder, Related Syndromes and Controversies', 'url': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Aviral_Verma5/publication/315528236_Ameloblastoma_and_its_Malignant_Transformation_Treatment_Ladder_Related_Syndromes_and_Controversies/links/58d3c8c2a6fdccd24d460d1f/Ameloblastoma-and-its-Malignant-Transformation-Treatment-Ladder-Related-Syndromes-and-Controversies.pdf', 'volume': '4', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:8wCixH_E2vEC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">A 57-year-old male known case of diabetic nephropathy since 4 years recently started on biweekly hemodialysis presented with subacute onset of difficulty in walking and slowness in daily activities of 3 months duration.

Normal load has been applied on the boundary of the existing media that is supposed to be permeated by a primary uniform magnetic field. We employ both the parabolic type (dual phase-lag magneto-thermoelasticity of type I (MTDPL-I)) and hyperbolic type (dual phase-lag magneto-thermoelasticity of type II (MTDPL-II)) dual phase-lag heat conduction models to account for the interactions among the magnetic, elastic and thermal fields. The integral transform technique is applied to solve the present problem and the analytical results of both cases have been obtained separately. A detailed analysis of results has been made in order to understand the nature of waves propagating inside the medium and the effects of the phase-lag parameters. The effect of the presence of magnetic field has been highlighted. Numerical results have also been obtained to analyze the effect of magnetic field on the behavior of the solution more clearly and a detailed analysis of the results predicted by two models has been presented. It has been noted that in some cases there are significant differences in the solution obtained in the contexts of MTDPL-I and MTDPL-II theory of magneto-thermoelasticity.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Rakhi Tiwari and Anil Kumar and Santwana Mukhopadhyay', 'eprint': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rakhi_Tiwari2/publication/312300296_Investigation_on_Magneto-thermoelastic_Disturbances_Induced_by_Thermal_Shock_in_an_Elastic_Half_Space_Having_Finite_Conductivity_under_Dual_Phase-lag_Heat_Conduction/links/5878f01008ae9275d4d90248/Investigation-on-Magneto-thermoelastic-Disturbances-Induced-by-Thermal-Shock-in-an-Elastic-Half-Space-Having-Finite-Conductivity-under-Dual-Phase-lag-Heat-Conduction.pdf', 'journal': 'Computational Methods in Science and Technology', 'number': '4', 'pages': '201--215', 'title': 'Investigation on Magneto-thermoelastic Disturbances Induced by Thermal Shock in an Elastic Half Space Having Finite Conductivity under Dual Phase-lag Heat Conduction', 'url': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rakhi_Tiwari2/publication/312300296_Investigation_on_Magneto-thermoelastic_Disturbances_Induced_by_Thermal_Shock_in_an_Elastic_Half_Space_Having_Finite_Conductivity_under_Dual_Phase-lag_Heat_Conduction/links/5878f01008ae9275d4d90248/Investigation-on-Magneto-thermoelastic-Disturbances-Induced-by-Thermal-Shock-in-an-Elastic-Half-Space-Having-Finite-Conductivity-under-Dual-Phase-lag-Heat-Conduction.pdf', 'volume': '22', 'year': 2016}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:5-tCjTwfAdEC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr">TK Aarrestad 224, D.

Due to this, the importance of oil shale as an economically viable substitute has enhanced many folds in last 20 years. Oil shale is a compact laminated rock of sedimentary origin containing organic matter known as kerogen which yields oil when distilled. Therefore, it is very important to understand the physico-mechanical behavior of such anisotropic rocks. The favorable characteristics of Assam coal for conversion to liquid fuels have been known for a long time. Studies have indicated that these coals and carbonaceous shale constitute the principal source rocks that have generated the hydrocarbons produced from the region. In the present work an attempt is made to understand the engineering behavior of Indian oil shales experimentally. The in situ coring is performed to get the samples for testing purposes, as coring in laboratory is very difficult due to its highly anisotropic nature. Different tests are performed to understand the petrology of these samples, further the chemical analyses are also done to exactly quantify the organic and inorganic contents in these rocks. The physical and mechanical properties of these rocks are investigated by considering different anisotropic angles. These properties and correlations will further help in increasing the yield of these rocks.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'KS Rao and A Kumar', 'journal': 'Rock Mechanics and Rock Engineering: From the Past to the Future', 'pages': '307', 'publisher': 'CRC Press', 'title': 'Engineering behavior of Indian oil shales', 'url': 'http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=5ziLDQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA307&dq=info:UFGU-pKhz_4J:scholar.google.com&ots=b0gSZ0sfcb&sig=WU32Lm9KcJasbxKb1AHcbGoXqU0', 'year': 2016}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:kSfMFMOdMMkC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">We develop and test a hypothesis that hedge-fund managers who respond to and capitalize on the changing political environment around Presidential elections are better skilled.

Narrowband interference (NBI) signals corrupts the subcarriers of MC-CDMA system and as a result its performance degrades. All the available NBI elimination methods uses some kind of filters and other circuitry prior to the demodulator (receiver) to filter out NBI. So addition of extra hardware to the system makes the system complex and slow. Moreover CDMA based systems are affected by digital NBI which gets superimposed with wideband spread spectrum signal. Multiuser detection could be an efficient technique to suppress NBI and multiple access interference (MAI). Computational complexity of optimum multiuser detector is an impediment in the way of an efficient multiuser detector. In this paper we propose a particle swarm optimization (PSO) based optimum multiuser detector to eliminate NBI. Simulation results show that performance of proposed PSO based multiuser detector is capable of eliminating NBI with much lesser amount of computational complexity.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Anmol Kumar and Rajdeep Kaur', 'eprint': 'http://www.mecs-press.org/ijisa/ijisa-v8-n10/IJISA-V8-N10-7.pdf', 'journal': 'International Journal of Intelligent Systems and Applications', 'number': '10', 'pages': '60', 'publisher': 'Modern Education and Computer Science Press', 'title': 'PSO-Based NBI Resistant Asynchronous MC-CDMA Multiuser Detector', 'url': 'http://www.mecs-press.org/ijisa/ijisa-v8-n10/IJISA-V8-N10-7.pdf', 'volume': '8', 'year': 2016}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:RTnHyEp0C-wC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">A study was conducted to assess the efficacy of herbs Azadiracta indica (Neem) and Ananus comosus (Pineapple) for the control of ascaridiosis in chicken.

Ensuring scalability of automated image captioning systems with respect to the ever increasing volume of image and video data is a significant challenge. This paper provides a valuable insight in that the detection of a few significant (top) objects in an image allows one to extract other relevant information such as actions (verbs) in the image. We expect this insight to be useful in the design of scalable image captioning systems. We address two parameters by which the scalability of image captioning systems could be quantified, ie, the traditional algorithmic time complexity which is important given the resource limitations of the user device and the system development time since the programmers\' time is a critical resource constraint in many real-world scenarios. Additionally, we address the issue of how word embeddings could be used to infer the verb (action) from the nouns (objects) in a given image in a zero-shot manner. Our results show that it is possible to attain reasonably good performance on predicting actions and captioning images using our approaches with the added advantage of simplicity of implementation.</div><div class="gsh_csp">Subjects: Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.

The anomalous change in intensity and full with at half maxima (FWHM) of Raman modes at 749 and 847\u2005cm−1 suggest change in oxygen octahedral closely related to dielectric properties of m-BZNT.</div></div>', 'author': 'Aditya Kumar and Manoj K Singh and Gulab Singh and K Sudheendran and KC James Raju', 'eprint': 'https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.4947997', 'journal': 'AIP Conference Proceedings', 'number': '1', 'pages': '090033', 'publisher': 'AIP Publishing', 'title': 'Raman spectra and dielectric studies in Ti substituted Bi2 (Zn2/3Nb4/3)O7 pyrochlores', 'url': 'https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4947997', 'volume': '1731', 'year': 2016}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:p-HGrieyzrAC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small">Cerium oxide has attained much attentions in global nanotechnology market due to valuable application for catalytic, fuel additive, and widely as electrolyte in solid oxide fuel cell.

Around the First World War, gyroscopes found use in aircrafts, where it is still being used. In the 1960s, optical gyroscopes were introduced and found commercial success in aeronautics and military. However, microelectromechanical system (MEMS) gyroscopes have been introduced only in the last 10–15 years [1]. These gyroscopes are of vibratory type (explained later in the chapter), when compared to the traditional spinning ones as they are easy to manufacture.</div><div class="gsh_csp">However, the mechanical defects of manufacturing process result in error emanating from MEMS structures, which, if not compensated, result in an unreliable end system. In contrast, complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) electronics, riding on Moore’s law, has facilitated access to transistors at an affordable cost. Thus, if the mechanical defects of the sensors can be detected through their respective electronics signature, there is a possibility of creating a highly robust and reliable system. The electromechanical feedback loops can enable such systems. The idea can be even extended to further the reliability and testability through embedding test signals. This chapter is organized as follows. Section 9.1 is the introduction. Section 9.2 provides a brief overview of the dynamics of vibratory gyroscope, more for the sake of completeness of the chapter and to facilitate the terminology for discussions in the later sections.

Towards this end Harel et al. proposed a measure named “M-score” which uses sensitivity weights in order to estimate misusablity. It can tell the risk level when data is exposed for mining. However, the sensitivity related aspects of this measure and distinguishing factors can be further improved. In this paper, we improve M-score to support multiple distinguishing factors and many combinations of sensitivity levels so as to make it more useful and accurate for estimating misusability of data before outsourcing it to third party for data mining.

Multi plate clutch is one of the important part in the power transmission systems. Good design of clutch provides better engine performance. Multi plate clutch is most widely used in ATV\'s, racing cars and heavy duty vehicle where high torque transmission required and limited space is available. The multi plate clutch has modelled in NX 9 software and imported in ANSYS Workbench 15. The structural analysis has been carried out for friction material clutch plate. The result of friction materials is based on the static and dynamic analysis, stress and total deformation and temperature variation and heat flux of the friction plate. Uniform wear theory were used for the analysis. The Grey Cast Iron and Kevlar 49 friction material are compared based on the total deformation of the clutch plate to find the better lining material. The Von Mises stress has been determined by varying the friction surfaces material-Grey Cast Iron and Kevlar 49. After that the FEM analysis is done for Kevlar friction material. The stresses &amp; deformation obtained for this friction material is then compared to analysis software result. The analysis is done for worn out friction disc.

The results indicated that five potato markets reacted on the long-run cointegrating equations while the speed of price adjustment in the short-run was almost absent. Moreover, it was found that the longer the distance between the markets, the weaker the integration was. To increase the efficiency of potato markets in Uttarakhand, there is need to focus on building an improved market information system.

Images and documents travel widely and rapidly, in multiple manifestations, through email and across the Internet. In this era of ecommunication i.e. electronic transmission of information that has been encoded digitally (as for storage and processing by computers), the first concern is about the security of the content which is shared during communication. While the information is over net, it is next to impossible to keep a track of where the information or the copy of information is going through. Security is a continuous process via which data can be secured from several active and passive attacks.

The proposed method of this dissertation gives new observation likelihood model with dynamic parameter setting. Experiments show our proposed method is more accurate and more efficient than the traditional colour histogram based particle filter. Integration of colour distribution into particle filters and shows how these distributions can be adopted overtime. A particle filter tracks several hypotheses simultaneously and weight them according to their similarity to the target model. As similarity measures between two colour distributions the popular Bhattacharyya coefficient is applied.

While there are a host of data on management of PVT in noncirrhotic patients, there are almost no robust data to guide management decisions for PVT in cirrhotic patients. Regarding the role of anticoagulation in patients with cirrhosis with PVT, although there are few reports of successful recanalisation with anticoagulation in selected patients, 3, 4 particularly those listed for liver transplantation, 5 the data are not robust and hence the AASLD position paper6 states:‘In the absence of robust data, recommendations for or against routine anticoagulation cannot be made.

Clutch actuation system consists of clutch pedal assembly, flexible cable mounted on body panel, and clutch release arm/shaft assembly inside transmission unit assembly. Clutch pedal load, travel and engagement point are important parameters to specify the actuation feeling while designing the clutch actuation system. Validation of actual values is being done at proto vehicle testing stage, as final output calculation may not be accurate due to dependency on variables difficult to estimate.

Infectious diseases have been reported to be accompanied by an altered host lipid metabolism due to differential expression of lipid metabolizing enzymes (esterases/lipases)(Forrellad et al., 2013, Deb et al., 2006). A significant inter-relationship between lipid metabolism and host responses has been reported. The factors by which the lipid metabolism is regulated, has been explored (Daniel et al., 2011). These enzymes are considered to be one of the known virulence factors in several bacteria. The lipid degrading enzymes of P. acne and S. epidermis were demonstrated to play a role in infection and subsequent persistence of bacteria on the human skin (Bruggemann, 2005; Otto, 2009). Several pathogenic bacteria including Mycobacterium were demonstrated to co-opt the lipid metabolism for their intracellular survival. On the other hand these hydrolytic enzymes contribute to invasiveness/proliferation by causing destruction of the host tissue followed by supplying hydrolyzed material as nutrients to the micro-organisms (Naglik et al., 2004). The presence of lipid inclusion bodies strongly suggested the importance of these lipid degrading enzymes.</div><div class="gsh_csp">M. tuberculosis has evolved several mechanisms to circumvent the hostile environment of the macrophage (Jayachandran et al., 2013).

Using supply-chain data and weekly co-search network of supply-chain partners from Bloomberg and Yahoo! Finance, respectively, we find that when investors of a focal stock pay less attention to its supply-chain partners, we can use lagged partner returns to predict the future return of the focal stock. When investors’ co-attention to focal and partner stocks is high, the predictability is low. We contribute to the growing literature on aggregate search and economics of networks by demonstrating the inferential power and economic implications of search networks.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Alvin Chung Man Leung and Prabhudev Konana and Ashish Agarwal and Alok Kumar', 'eprint': 'https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/519f/66bea298979cc94fb539e9e8771d42ab9de4.pdf', 'publisher': 'Americas Conference on Information Systems', 'title': 'A study of search attention and stock returns cross predictability', 'url': 'https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/519f/66bea298979cc94fb539e9e8771d42ab9de4.pdf', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:T3x1S4x-kFYC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">[en] A geochemical study has been conducted in southwest part of Punjab state to assess the hydrochemistry of groundwater and uranium occurrence.

Here, the alamouti scheme and fuzzy rules of wireless sensor networks proves to be the efficient techniques to reduce the BER. Transmit diversity and Fuzzy logic have been used under the modulator namely as QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation), for a specified order of the QAM. From the analysis it has been observed that QAM modulation of alamouti scheme performs much better with the implementation of Fuzzy logic and performance is better than the performance of alamouti scheme without Fuzzy implementation. The modulation order in the QAM modulation technique\'M\'is also a very essential parameter in getting the performance better, as the modulation order increases the SER value starts decreasing step by step It has been observed from the simulation results for PAPR reduction that higher order modulation techniques are better as compared to the lower order modulation techniques. It has been analyzed that, transmit diversity scheme with the QAM modulator and implementation of fuzzy logic provides the better error reduction performance compared to BPSK modulator. The alamouti diversity scheme with fuzzy logic in wireless communication proves to be an efficient approach in different fading channels. This approach mitigates the effect of multipath fading and improves the performance of the system and thus the diversity gain. Hence, the impact of transmit diversity in wireless communication proves to be a very efficient, promising and successful indeed.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Himani Singh and Ashwani Kumar', 'eprint': 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.740.439&rep=rep1&type=pdf', 'title': 'A NEW FUZZY BASED TRANSMIT DIVERSITY SCHEME FOR WSN', 'url': 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.740.439&rep=rep1&type=pdf', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:_xmTp9Pj6u8C', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Power theft is a serious concern for public, for utility company and for government. Power theft detection is hard to detect using conventional protection methods, so an advanced protection scheme must be developed to manage the issue. An effective protection plan against power theft needs to effectively face the issues of detection and identification simultaneously. In this scheme of power theft detection, unapproved tapping on distribution lines are detected. However, present systems are not able to detect unapproved tapping on distribution lines. But in this system, it is able to recognize which distribution line has tapping. An execution area of this power theft detection system is a distribution network. In this work, wireless data communication technique is used. With this wireless technique, it gives a wireless meter reading, which is also useful for power theft detection.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Rakesh Dwivedi and Ashwani Kumar and Sandhya Dubey', 'eprint': 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.739.9354&rep=rep1&type=pdf', 'title': 'DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF POWER THEFT DETECTION IN AUTOMATIC METER READING USING POWER LINE COMMUNICATION', 'url': 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.739.9354&rep=rep1&type=pdf', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:27qsyVibG6YC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">The study was undertaken to obtain an objective and realistic overview of the analytical performance of modified QuEChERS method for analysis of specific pesticide residues using low cost adsorbent.

The American College of Rheumatology guidelines for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee recommended that one treatment option to be considered is the use of intra-articular injections of hyaluronic acid for the relief of osteoarthritic pain. Objective: To describe the patient characteristics and the add-on clinical effect of viscosupplementation on physical function, pain and stiffness in patients receiving diacerein for primary knee osteoarthritis. Methods: The study recruited 39 primary osteoarthritis patients suffering from the OA for at least 6 months of which 18 were male and 21female patients age range 40-80 years and classified according to the Kellgren-Lawrence system of Grade 2-3. Intraarticular hyaluronic acid supplementation in target knee was given in OPD setting over 5 weekly doses. Results: Intensity of knee pain, stiffness, physical function of knee joint shows significant improvement for 6 months of intra-articular hyaluronic acid supplementation and non significant improvement till 1 year of follow up in primary osteoarthritic knees. Conclusion: Intraarticular hyaluronic acid viscosupplementation along with diacerin is an effective combination in the management of chronic OA pain, stiffness and maintaining physical functions over long time.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Deo Rishi Tripathi and Mahesh Kumar Talele and Amod Kumar and Harleen Uppal and Deepak Kumar', 'eprint': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kumar_Deepak2/publication/281034919_Viscosupplementation_with_Hyaluronic_acid_as_an_Adjuvant_to_Diacerein_in_improving_Pain_Stiffness_and_Physical_function_in_Primary_Osteoarthritic_Knees_a_1_year_follow-up_observation_study/links/55d2226008ae0a341720e3d5/Viscosupplementation-with-Hyaluronic-acid-as-an-Adjuvant-to-Diacerein-in-improving-Pain-Stiffness-and-Physical-function-in-Primary-Osteoarthritic-Knees-a-1-year-follow-up-observation-study.pdf', 'title': 'Viscosupplementation with Hyaluronic acid as an Adjuvant to Diacerein in improving Pain, Stiffness and Physical function in Primary Osteoarthritic Knees: a 1 year follow-up …', 'url': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kumar_Deepak2/publication/281034919_Viscosupplementation_with_Hyaluronic_acid_as_an_Adjuvant_to_Diacerein_in_improving_Pain_Stiffness_and_Physical_function_in_Primary_Osteoarthritic_Knees_a_1_year_follow-up_observation_study/links/55d2226008ae0a341720e3d5/Viscosupplementation-with-Hyaluronic-acid-as-an-Adjuvant-to-Diacerein-in-improving-Pain-Stiffness-and-Physical-function-in-Primary-Osteoarthritic-Knees-a-1-year-follow-up-observation-study.pdf', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:NGoJ35N4lvkC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div><div><div class="gsh_csp">Intra-seasonal lack(excess) of rainfall that lead to situations of meteorological drought (flood) in one or other part of country every year apart from inter-annual variability of rainfall(Krishnamurthy, 2000).

Makhana is mainly sold and marketed in the popped or puffed form. To develop any kind of mechanized system for processing the knowledge of physical and mechanical properties is desired. These properties will be useful for designing and development of processing equipment. The different physical and mechanical properties were determined at two moisture levels ie 4% and 12% using standard methods. As the moisture content increases the physical characteristics (Length, width, thickness, Da &amp; Dg) &amp; gravimetric characteristics (sphericity, aspect ratio, surface area &amp; volume) of all the grades increases linearly. The negative relation was observed with geometrical characteristics. Major variations were also observed in angle of repose &amp; coefficient of static friction at different grades and moisture levels. The result concludes that different grades and variation in the moisture level affects almost all the physical &amp; mechanical properties significantly (p&lt; 0.05).</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Kumar Sandeep and RACHNA SEHRAWAT and ANIT KUMAR and KHALID BASIR and KUMAR SATYA PRAKASH', 'eprint': 'http://www.academia.edu/download/45223894/Effect_of_Different_Grades_on_Physical_and_Mechanical_Properties_of_popped_makhana.pdf', 'journal': 'International Journal of Processing and Post Harvest Technology', 'number': '1', 'pages': '101-108', 'publisher': 'Hind Agri-Horticultural Society', 'title': 'Effect of Different Grades on Physical and Mechanical Properties of Popped Makhana', 'url': 'http://www.academia.edu/download/45223894/Effect_of_Different_Grades_on_Physical_and_Mechanical_Properties_of_popped_makhana.pdf', 'volume': '6', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:hrkNWuzUpWwC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">[en] Everyone on the planet is exposed to some background level of ionizing radiation.

These can be leveraged to contribute towards relief initiatives during natural disasters. This study explores the creative responses of Fortune 100 companies towards a host of social, environmental, community, and infrastructure challenges arising during natural disasters. Through an analysis of information available on the websites of top Fortune 100 companies (N= 100) in the US during 2013, it is found that most corporations have been engaging in disaster-related activities for social and ethical reasons. Relief and recovery activities can be short-term or long-term. Short-term activities included financial help. The longer-term initiatives encompassed a wider stakeholder group, with activities ranging from financial assistance to collaborative partnerships with public entities such as NGOs and governments. Companies also help in disaster management simply by going about their business. Recovering with nimbleness, restarting operations, and springing back agilely is often the best way to contribute to community re-building. Companies have invested in advanced technologies to aid communities in not just withstanding disasters, but also in their long-standing development. The study concludes that companies can play a key role in disaster resilience, response, and recovery.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Arvind Kumar and Hamendra Kumar Dangi and K Singh', 'eprint': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anna_Nyquist3/publication/320100770_Nyquist_A_Green_marketing_self-regulation_and_marketing_trust_A_discourse_analysis_of_ISO_14001_In_ed_Mittal_and_Gupta_CSR_and_Sustainable_Development_a_Multinational_Perspective/links/59ce04d8aca272b0ec1a2e79/Nyquist-A-Green-marketing-self-regulation-and-marketing-trust-A-discourse-analysis-of-ISO-14001-In-ed-Mittal-and-Gupta-CSR-and-Sustainable-Development-a-Multinational-Perspective.pdf#page=72', 'pages': '53-62', 'publisher': 'Society for Education & Research Development', 'title': 'The Role of top 100 Fortune Companies in Natural Disaster Management', 'url': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anna_Nyquist3/publication/320100770_Nyquist_A_Green_marketing_self-regulation_and_marketing_trust_A_discourse_analysis_of_ISO_14001_In_ed_Mittal_and_Gupta_CSR_and_Sustainable_Development_a_Multinational_Perspective/links/59ce04d8aca272b0ec1a2e79/Nyquist-A-Green-marketing-self-regulation-and-marketing-trust-A-discourse-analysis-of-ISO-14001-In-ed-Mittal-and-Gupta-CSR-and-Sustainable-Development-a-Multinational-Perspective.pdf#page=72', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:I9gX6wnfuA8C', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Let R be a prime ring with char≠ 2, D (.,.) be a symmetric bi-derivation of R, 0≠ d be trace of D (.,.), f–(α, β) r–d be right almost Jordan generalized derivation of R, β is surjective and a∈ R.

Estrogen and testosterone both are an important hormone for male and female. Estrogen has an important role in the development of breast cancer, ovarian cancer etc. There are very few studies available which describe the increased oral cancer incidence and level of estrogen in male oral cancer patients and use of smokeless tobacco consumption among the same type of cancer patients. Therefore, the present study has been aimed to find out the prevalence of oral cancer due to consumption of smokeless tobacco, sub-site distribution and level of estrogen in the oral cancer patients in Bihar. In the present study 126 patients suffering from oral cancer were selected randomly. The background data obtained were categorized into sex-wise as well as age-wise oral cancer incidence, carcinoma site, frequency of oral cancer and the type of tobacco addiction among the surveyed oral cancer patients. Estrogen level in male oral cancer patients was assessed by ELISA-kit method. Addiction of khaini among all of the smoke and smokeless tobacco consuming persons in Bihar was found higher. Prevalence of oral cancer was four times higher in male patients than the female and the level of estrogen hormone in male oral cancer patients were found elevated. In conclusion, high oral cancer incidence has been observed among people of Bihar. Most popular form of smokeless tobacco is khaini mainly used by illiterate people.

Different factors influenced T-DNA delivery as evident from transient GUS assay. The transient GUS expression was significantly higher in explants that were pre-cultured before bacterial infection on medium supplemented with 100 μM acetosyringone. Method of injury to explant, co-cultivation period of 2 days, bacterial density of 0.6 OD600 and 16 h photoperiod during co-cultivation showed higher transient GUS expression. Following co-cultivation, shoot organogenesis was achieved from leaf segments on modified MS medium containing 58 mM sucrose. Between two strains of A. Tumefaciens namely, EHA105 and LBA4404 (harbouring pBI121 plasmid), strain LBA4404 was found to be more efficient. Between two clones of P.deltoides tested, maximum transient GUS activity was recorded in clone ‘L34’. Different concentration of antibiotic was investigated to check the sensitivity of leaf explants. Supplementation of antibiotics (cefotaxime) at 500 mg/l into the medium significantly promoted shoot organogenesis from leaf explants.

This vampire attack is a resource depletion attacks at the routing protocol layer, which permanently disconnect the networks by quickly draining nodes’ battery power. These “Vampire” attacks are not specific to any specific protocol, but rather depend on the characteristics of many popular classes of routing protocols. This project illustrates a technique to tolerate the attack by employing the Cluster Head. In case of each Vampire attack, the Cluster Head employs in this situation and distributes the packet to destination without dropping the packet. Thus give a successful and reliable message delivery even in case of Vampire attack. In the worst case, a single Vampire can increase network wide energy usage by a factor of O (N), where N is the number of network nodes.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'K GURU PRASAD and K SRINIVAS REDDY and A RAVI KUMAR', 'eprint': 'http://ijsetr.com/uploads/512364IJSETR2316-858.pdf', 'title': 'Vampire Attack in Wireless Ad-Hoc Sensor Networks using Mitigating', 'url': 'http://ijsetr.com/uploads/512364IJSETR2316-858.pdf', 'year': 2014}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:X1y8G5kAG8gC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Online social networking has become one of the most popular activities on the web. Online social networks (OSNs), such as Facebook, are increasingly utilized by many people. OS Ns allow users to control and customize what personal information is available to other users. These networks allow users to publish details about themselves and to connect to their friends. Some of the information revealed inside these networks is meant to be private. A privacy breach occurs when sensitive information about the user, the information that an individual wants to keep from public, is disclosed to an adversary. Yet it is possible to use learning algorithms on released data to predict private information. Private information leakage could be an important issue in some cases. And explore how to launch inference attacks using released social networking data to predict private information. Desired use of data and individual privacy presents an opportunity for privacy-preserving social network data mining. Then devise three possible sanitization techniques that could be used in various situations. The effect of removing details and links in preventing sensitive information leakage. Removing details and friendship links together is the best way to reduce classifier accuracy. This is probably infeasible in maintaining the use of social networks.

Chitosan itself is also found in some microorganisms and in yeast and fungi (Watts et al., 1999). Chitosan is biodegradable in nature and its biocompatibility as well as physiochemical characteristics of hydrophobically modified glycol chitosan nanoparticles in murine osteosarcoma and osteoblast–like cells have been evaluated recently (Chin et al., 2014) Chitosan is available in a broad range of molecular weights and its properties can be modified by changing the degree of deacetylation and the environment of the formulation (Davis and Illum, 2003). Due to its protonated amino functions in solution and its resultant polycationic nature, chitosan readily adheres to negatively charged surfaces, such as mucus and proteins. Numerous studies in mice and human (Davis and Illum, 2003; Moschos et al., 2004) have demonstrated that chitosan and their soluble derivatives are effective and safe adsorption enhancers to improve nasal and peroral delivery of hydrophilic antigens such as peptide and protein drugs and heparins. In these models, the absorption enhancing effect is caused by the opening of the intercellular tight junctions, thereby favouring the paracellular transport of macromolecular drugs, and by slowing down mucociliary clearance, thus maintaining the contact of antigen with the mucosa for a longer period of time, thereby …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Vimal Kumar and Satyabrata Dandapat and Ananda Kumar and Niranjan Kumar', 'eprint': 'http://www.nexusacademicpublishers.com/uploads/files/Nexus_467.pdf', 'title': 'Preparation and Characterization of Chitosan Nanoparticles “Alternatively, Carrying Potential’’for Cellular and Humoral Immune Responses', 'url': 'http://www.nexusacademicpublishers.com/uploads/files/Nexus_467.pdf', 'year': 2014}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:Y3Sh7dCAXz0C', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Malaria is known as a great mimic.

Steganography is a technique of hiding information in some other media like in images, video, text, audio. Image are the popular medium for hiding information because in image different planes available with very little variation of pixel values. In this thesis work three algorithms are proposed for security of data. In the first algorithm Negative of original image is hidden in cover image for security purposes. During implementation, pixels of negative image are to be substituted in the cover image pixels. In this Even Odd algorithm is proposed for hiding image in the cover image using existing modified LSB algorithm. The second algorithm calculates the Mean Square Error (MSE), Peak Signal Noise Ratio (PSNR) using XORing algorithm and compare with the existing Steganography algorithms in MATLAB. In the third algorithm, first the encrypted data is generated by determining their class. After that encrypted data is hidden in random bits of cover image using XORing method. By doing XORing the probability of pixel variation reduces as compared to replacing method as done in LSB or Modified LSB method.

However, no structural investigation on amorphous thin films prepared by different methods has been reported so far.

Mine production scheduling problem can be solved using various approaches, but the best approach is one which can give an optimal result. Production scheduling solely cannot result in a proper planning thus, fleet assignment problem needs to be incorporated into production scheduling problem to have a realistic mine plan. Proper fleet assignment ensures that the fleet is not under or over utilized. Fleet assignment problem is integer type programming since, size of fleet cannot be a floating number. In this thesis, production scheduling and fleet assignment problem are solved using branch and cut algorithm. Production schedule for 4736 blocks from a case study of coal mine is done with a production period of 5 years. Solution time for solving the production scheduling problem was 48.14 hours with an NPV value of Rs 4.45938x1011. Short terms production scheduling is done for one year and the NPV value obtained was Rs 7.59796x1010 with a solution time of 57.539 minutes.

It is well known that the acute effects of smoking produce an increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, tachycardia, vasoconstriction, increase in carotid artery occlusion, and sometimes instantaneous Myocardial infarction. The present study was undertaken to study the effects of smoking on blood pressure in young apparently healthy individuals. OBJECTIVE: To compare blood pressure values between smokers and non-smokers. METHODOLOGY: The study was conducted in the Department of Physiology, Vijayanagar Institute of Medical Sciences, Bellary, Karnataka. The study included 100 apparently healthy males, 50 smokers and 50 non-smokers, between ages 20-35 years. Demographic data, history of smoking habit (quantity and duration) and detailed medical history were obtained from the subjects. Heart rate and blood pressure were recorded. Results were compared from the two groups using statistical tools. RESULTS: There was statistically significant increase in heart rate, systolic blood pressure as well as diastolic blood pressure in smokers when compared to non-smokers. CONCLUSION: The study shows that systolic as well as diastolic blood pressures were elevated in the absence of any cardiac disease in smokers.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Prashanth Babu and Arun Kumar', 'eprint': 'https://jemds.com/latest-articles.php?at_id=3541', 'journal': 'A STUDY OF EFFECT OF SMOKING ON BLOOD PRESSURE IN HEALTHY YOUNG ADULTS', 'number': '3541', 'title': 'Smokers; Non-smokers; Heart rate, Systolic blood Pressure, Diastolic blood pressure.', 'url': 'https://jemds.com/latest-articles.php?at_id=3541', 'year': 2014}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:EKd_EOGQzkMC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': "A CeIl-free proteiD synthesizing system from tbe germinating wheat embryos bas been optimized for the translation of heterologous exogenous mRNAs.

class="gsh_csp">The effect of cutting tool geometry has long been an issue in understanding mechanics of turning. Tool geometry has significant influence on chip formation, heat generation, tool wear, surface finish and surface integrity during turning. This article presents a survey on variation in tool geometry ie tool nose radius, rake angle, groove on the rake face, variable edge geometry, wiper geometry and curvilinear edge tools and their effect on tool wear, surface roughness and surface integrity of the machined surface. The cutting tool is an important basic tool required in the machining process of a part in production. It not only performs the cutting action but helps in getting required surface finish and accuracy of the part. In order to perform these tasks the tool has to be strong enough to withstand wear resistance and serve for long period of time to produce more number of components with the same accuracy. Machining is important in metal manufacturing process to achieve near-net shape, good dimensional accuracy and for aesthetic requirements. In modern machining process and using the CNC machine tools the cutting tool will play a vital role in machining process and in improving the surface finish. Many reputed cutting tool manufacturing organizations globally with their rich experience of research and development, invented different ways of enhancing the life of cutting tool in order to optimise the rate of the production and to reduce the cost of production, which is highly acceptable to the manufacturing Industry. This paper deals with the ways of improving the tool life by various coatings on tungsten based cemented carbide cutting tool.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Abhishek Kumar and Arun Singh and MS Ranganath and RC Singh', 'eprint': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ranganath_Singari/publication/274193300_Review_of_Effect_of_Tool_Geometry_Variation_on_Finish_Turning_and_Improving_Cutting_Tool_Life/links/551820680cf2d70ee27b0436/Review-of-Effect-of-Tool-Geometry-Variation-on-Finish-Turning-and-Improving-Cutting-Tool-Life.pdf', 'journal': 'International Conference of Advance Research and Innovation ICARI-2014', 'pages': '566-571', 'title': 'Review of Effect of Tool Geometry Variation on Finish Turning and Improving Cutting Tool Life', 'url': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ranganath_Singari/publication/274193300_Review_of_Effect_of_Tool_Geometry_Variation_on_Finish_Turning_and_Improving_Cutting_Tool_Life/links/551820680cf2d70ee27b0436/Review-of-Effect-of-Tool-Geometry-Variation-on-Finish-Turning-and-Improving-Cutting-Tool-Life.pdf', 'year': 2014}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:9kZNi-u_WhAC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"> <div class="gsh_csp">Electron microscopy, particularly when used in association with physiological, biochemical and genetic studies, provides valuable information on the complex relationships which exist between host and pathogen.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Govind Singh Saharan and Prithwi Raj Verma and Prabhu Dayal Meena and Arvind Kumar', 'pages': '189-192', 'publisher': 'Springer, New Delhi', 'title': 'Fine Structures', 'url': 'https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-81-322-1792-3_11', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:jQdzyB-Dl8gC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Biomass incorporation in soil, though beneficial is not widely adopted by farming community due to non-availability of suitable machines. The present study is an improvement over the existing model of rotary tiller through introduction of three mechanical interventions viz.,(i) eight sets of rotary blades with critical bending angle,(ii) 1200 mm long compression reel ahead of rotar assembly and,(iii) discs. Both modified and existing models were tested for in-situ incorporation of legume crops. It showed that with modified rotary tiller, incorporation efficiency increased to 80, 86 and 72% from the earlier 54, 60, and 44% in case of cowpea, horsegram and sunhemp crops, respectively. Chopping efficiency increased to 81, 78, and 69% from the earlier 38, 32 and 21%, respectively with these crops. Both these models were tested at 5 soil moisture content levels viz., 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30% to determine the moisture level for obtaining maximum efficiency. Results showed that maximum efficiency of rotary tiller was attained at 18% of soil moisture. These machines were also tested under two soil types ie Alfisols and Vertisols. Higher efficiency of rotary tiller registered in Alfisols than Vertisols. It was concluded that design modifications of critical components in rotary tiller resulted in greater performance on improving biomass incorporation efficiency.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'RV Adake and VM Mayande and I Srinivas and BS Reddy and CR Thyagaraj and ACS Kumar', 'eprint': 'http://drylandagri.org.in/Journals/2014vol29-num2-18.pdf', 'journal': 'Indian J.

To overcome these problems, a variable preamble length-based broadcasting scheme is proposed. The proposed scheme uses a small preamble of variable size before the data packet is broadcast to mitigate the problem of excessive energy consumption due to large preambles without compromising the reachability. The preamble size varies depending on the network density. An existing probability-based broadcasting scheme is implemented and compared with the proposed schemes. A detailed analytical study is also done for the proposed variable preamble length-based broadcasting scheme and an existing probability-based broadcasting scheme for WSNs. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme conserves up to 19% of energy without compromising the reachability and throughput. The schemes are also implemented on real nodes, and the results compared with simulation results. To further improve the performance and conserve energy of sensor nodes, we have proposed a coverage-based adaptive preamble broadcasting protocol, which exploits the advantages of existing coverage-based as well as counter-based schemes. It dynamically adjusts the preamble length of a rebroadcast packet according to the node density in the host’s neighbourhood without any prior knowledge about the neighbouring hosts. It uses the extra coverage to infer the node density and the duplicate packet counter, regardless of the number of neighbours in the network. The proposed scheme can be integrated with …</div></div>', 'author': 'Arun Kumar', 'title': 'Energy-efficient broadcasting in wireless ad-hoc sensor networks', 'url': 'https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/handle/10356/59866', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:ChsjQIg5EFEC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small">The term "Distributed Real-Time Computing System” is described whenever number of computers interconnected in some fashion such that a program or procedure utilizes this distributed but combined power and gets executed in Real Time. The term has different meanings with regard to different systems, because processors can be interconnected in many ways for various reasons. In its most general form, the word distribution implies that the processors are fixed in geographically separated locations. Occasionally, the term is also applied to an operating environment using multiple mini-computers not connected with each other with the help of physical communication lines but are connected through satellite. In a Distributed Real Time System (DRTS), the single communication channel share by all the processors for Inter-Processor Communication (IPC). A program whose execution is distributed among several processors in a distributed system has the total processing cost equal to the sum of processors costs and Inter Tasks Communication Cost (ITCC), which are function of the amount of data transmitted. An optimal assignment is a distribution of modules that has lowest total Execution Cost (EC). The model discussed in this paper provides an optimal solution for assigning a set of “m” tasks to a set of “n” processors where m &gt;&gt; n, in such a way that allocated load on all processors is balanced according to the relative speed.

Digital image watermarking is one such technology that has been developed to protect digital images from illegal manipulations. In this paper, a new robust digital image watermarking algorithm based on Joint DWT-DCT Transformation is proposed. The imperceptibility is provided as well as higher robustness against common signal processing attacks. The watermarked image is embedded in certain sub-bands of a 3-level DWT transformed of a host image. Then, DCT transform of each selected DWT sub-band is computed and the PN-sequences of the watermark bits are embedded in the coefficients of corresponding DCT middle frequencies. Then, the same approach as the embedding process is used to extract the DCT middle frequencies of each sub-band. Finally, correlation between mid-band coefficients and PN-sequences is calculated to determine watermarked bits.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'A Sai Kumar and K Nishanth Rao and S Narasimha Rao', 'eprint': 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.740.1636&rep=rep1&type=pdf', 'title': 'A ROBUST ALGORITHM FOR DIGITAL IMAGE COPYRIGHT PROTECTION', 'url': 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.740.1636&rep=rep1&type=pdf', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:qwOXE0mbtu4C', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Use of Patterns Institution: Florida Atlantic University Dissertation Advisor: Dr. Eduardo B.

Given a table, the operation finds all tuple’s that are not dominated by any other tuple’s. It is found that the existing algorithms cannot process skyline on big data efficiently. This paper presents a novel skyline algorithm SSPL [1] on big data. SSPL utilizes sorted positional index lists which require low space overhead to reduce I/O cost significantly. We present a new indexing method named ZINC [2](for Z-order indexing with Nested Code) that supports efficient skyline computation for data with both totally and partially ordered attribute domains. By combining the strengths of the Z-order indexing method with a novel nested encoding scheme to represent partial orders, ZINC [2] is able to encode partial orders of varying complexity in a concise manner while maintaining a good clustering of the PO domain values. Our experimental results have demonstrated that ZINC [2] outperforms the state-ofthe-art TSS technique for various settings.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'K Venkata Raju and A Vijaya Kumar and MD Mounika and K Sandeep', 'eprint': 'http://www.ijaer.com/images/short_pdf/1425635327_K_Venkata_Raju_May_1.pdf', 'journal': 'International Journal of Applied Engineering Research', 'number': '19', 'pages': '6391-6399', 'title': 'High Dimensional Data Computation using ZINC Experiments', 'url': 'http://www.ijaer.com/images/short_pdf/1425635327_K_Venkata_Raju_May_1.pdf', 'volume': '9', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:eLRq4zTgah0C', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"> <div class="gsh_csp">This paper presents fabrication of microelectrode structure for SWCNT chemiresistor and its electrical characterization.

Here, the venation patterns of leaflets, stipules and tendrils were compared in the model species, P. sativum. Unlike reticulated venation in leaflets and stipules, venation in tendrils comprised of one or more primary veins. A few secondaries were attached to a primary vein, mostly distally. Bilaterally symmetrical secondary veins were rare. The primary veins in tendrils were daughter strands from dichotomously divided mother veins in rachis, connected finally to vascular strands in stem. A tendril received primary vein from one or more mother strands. Some mother strands contributed primary veins to proximal, distal and terminal domain tendrils of af leaf. The tendrils shared the multi-primary vein character with stipules. Vein redundancy provided a mechanism for survival of tendril/leaf against injury to some of the veins/mother veins. The presence of aborted primary veins that did not reach apex, rows of cambium cells attached to primary vein(s) at apex, the pattern of attachment of primary veins to mother veins and cessation of vein growth in apical direction in aborted tendrils of af lld genotype indicated that the growth of primary veins and tendril was acropetal. Loss-of-function of AF extended the repression of TL and MFP genes on leaflet development from distal and apical domains to proximal domain of leaves in af mutants.</div></div>', 'author': 'Vishakha Sharma and Arvind Kumar and Sushil Kumar', 'eprint': 'http://223.31.159.10:8080/jspui/bitstream/123456789/458/1/Kumar%20S_2014_3.pdf', 'publisher': 'National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources-NISCAIR', 'title': 'An analysis of vascular system in the compound tendrilled afila leaf in Pisum sativum', 'url': 'http://223.31.159.10:8080/jspui/handle/123456789/458', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:qmtmRrLr0tkC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Habitat loss is the major factor affecting the tiger population, so it is vital to identify and map the most suitable habitats to ensure more protection andfor the conservation plans.

To date biocatalytic reduction of Acetophenone and its derivatives has been widely reported. We have made an attempt to screen some of the microorganisms which were obtained from culture collection centre as well as those isolated in our microbiology lab, for their potential and performance in reduction of ketones. Among the screened microorganisms, used for the reduction of Acetophenone and its derivatives, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger showed significant bioconversion where as Candida viswanathii and Sacchromyces crevisae exhibited the least conversion. As Aspergillus flavus showed maximum ability of bioreduction, it was considered for optimization. The parameter evaluated during optimization includes pH, temperature, and substrate concentration and incubation time. Bioreduction of Acetophenone and p-chloroacetophenone was carried out using seven different strains of fungi. All the strains selected exhibited reduction capability. However, maximum reduction was observed with Aspergillus flavus and the least with Baker’s yeast.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Pankaj Kumar Patel and Sanjay Singh and Anup Kumar and MS Sandhyavali and SR Priyadarshini and IK Yadav', 'eprint': 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.429.3352&rep=rep1&type=pdf', 'journal': 'Indian Journal of Research in Pharmacy and Biotechnology', 'number': '1', 'pages': '1020', 'publisher': 'Indian Journal of Research in Pharmacy and Biotechnology', 'title': 'Microbial reduction of ketones and its derivatives', 'url': 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.429.3352&rep=rep1&type=pdf', 'volume': '2', 'year': 2014}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:3bvyWxjaHKcC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"> <div class="gsh_csp">Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a localized dilatation of the abdominal aorta. It occurs when there is a increase in the normal diameter of the blood vessels by more than 50 percent. Approximately 90 percent of abdominal aortic aneurysms occur infrarenally, but they can also occur pararenally or suprarenally. This is because of some catastrophic outcome. Due to this, the blood flow is exaggerated so the blood hemodynamic interaction forces are affected. Therefore this will tends to wall rupture. To identify the AAA, it is important to identify the blood flow interaction and the wall shear stress. The blood and wall interaction is the wall shear stress. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is used to get the results for the mechanical conditions within the blood vessels with and without Aneurysms. CFD contains vast computations with Navier Stroke Equations so this will be very time consuming.

Our conjecture is that true investment skill would not depend upon geographical proximity between investors and firms, while opportunistic access to information is likely to be location-dependent. Thus, if institutions are truly skilled, they would earn high average return and exhibit performance persistence in both their local and nonlocal trades. Our evidence indicates that institutions on average are not skilled and their superior intraquarter performance is more likely to reflect opportunistic access to shortterm local information. They have high average local performance but this performance is not persistent. Further, we observe increased local trading activity and profitability prior to earnings announcements, particularly before negative news. In contrast, the average net nonlocal intraquarter trading profits are not significantly different from zero. There is persistence in non-local performance, however, which suggests that some investors in the cross-section may be skilled. Specifically, investors with superior non-local performance exhibit superior future performance in both non-local and local trades. This evidence indicates that superior performance in non-local trades is a better indicator of innate trading skill.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Gennaro BERNILE and Alok Kumar and Johan Sulaeman and Qin Wang', 'eprint': 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.650.7575&rep=rep1&type=pdf', 'pages': '1977-1984', 'title': 'Are Institutional Investors Really Skilled or Merely Opportunistic?.(2013).

Around the First World War, gyroscopes found use in aircrafts, where it is still being used. In the 1960s, optical gyroscopes were introduced and found commercial success in aeronautics and military. However, microelectromechanical system (MEMS) gyroscopes have been introduced only in the last 10—15 years [1]. These gyroscopes are of vibratory type (explained later in the chapter), when compared to the traditional spinning ones as they are easy to manufacture.</div><div class="gsh_csp">However, the mechanical defects of manufacturing process result in error emanating from MEMS structures, which, if not compensated, result in an unreliable end system. In contrast, complementary metal—oxide—semiconductor (CMOS) electronics, riding on Moore’s law, has facilitated access to transistors at an affordable cost. Thus, if the mechanical defects of the sensors can be detected through their respective electronics signature, there is a possibility of creating a highly robust and reliable system. The electromechanical feedback loops can enable such systems. The idea can be even extended to further the reliability and testability through embedding test signals. This chapter is organized as follows. Section 9.1 is the introduction.

We find that among the set of financial assets, the value-minus-growth (HML) portfolio serves as the most effective instrument for hedging income risk. Further, income hedging-induced demand predicts the future returns of value-minus-growth portfolios. The future aggregate value premium as well as the returns of state-level value-minusgrowth portfolios are higher when income hedging-induced demands are high. In economic terms, one standard deviation shift in hedging demand is associated with 1.29% higher HML return next month. This evidence of predictability weakens as the predictability horizon increases, which suggests that hedging-induced demand shifts only have short-term impact on asset prices.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Jawad M Addoum and George M Korniotis and Alok Kumar', 'eprint': 'https://www.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/wbs/subjects/finance/events/seminars/alok_kumar.pdf', 'title': 'Income Hedging and Short-Term Return Predictability', 'url': 'https://www.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/wbs/subjects/finance/events/seminars/alok_kumar.pdf', 'year': 2013}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:f2IySw72cVMC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"> <div class="gsh_csp">A comparative study of etching and annealing characteristics of Makrofol-DE for <sup>28</sup>Si ions for different energies i.e. 100áMeV and 1.2áGeV was carried out.

Higher embedding efficiency translates into better steganographic security. This gain is more important for long messages than for shorter ones because longer messages are in general easier to detect. In this paper, we present a new approach called two way embedding Compared with the original matrix embedding, the proposed method can exponentially reduce the computational complexity for equal increment of embedding efficiency.

Under the framework of sequential recovery, we present an forward error concealment interpolation scheme derived from the pixel wise statistical model. We also investigate the problem of error propagation with recovery and propose a boundary matching strategy to alleviate it.

This portion is totally immersed in known concentrations of common salt solution which acts as guiding medium. One end of the fiber is connected to source of 820nm, 850nm for plastic fiber and 1300nm, 1550nm for silica glass fiber. The second end of the fiber is connected to a power meter through which the output power is measured. The power loss which is the difference of power launched into the fiber and power collected at the second end of the fiber is noted.

As most of the prosthodontic rehabilitations are centered on technical skills and clinical judgment expertise, dentists therefore became aware of such a time-dependent relationship between form and functional changes in the masticatory system.

The emergence of multidrug-resistant strains of Salmonella with increased virulence and survivability, leading to increased morbidity and mortality, has further complicated its management. Presently available vaccines against fowl typhoid have less-than-desired efficacy and unacceptable side effects, making it pertinent to search for new immunogens suitable for vaccine formulation. The outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of Salmonella have been considered as possible candidates for protection against typhoid. The present study was conducted to characterise the OMPs of Salmonella enterica serovar Gallinarum using immunodiffusion and western blot techniques. Presence of three precipitation lines against OMP preparation in immunodiffusion test indicated the presence of at least three immunogenic OMPs in S. Gallinarum. Further, western blot analysis revealed OMP 40 as one of the most immunopotent antigen.

Knowledge management is any process or practice of creating, acquiring, capturing, sharing and using knowledge, wherever it resides, to enhance learning and performance in organizations. In education, knowledge management can be considered as an approach that enables people within an organization to develop a set of practices to collect information and share what they now, leading to action that improves services and outcomes. The study aims to apply knowledge management practices in helping faculty or lecturers as well as students to gather and share knowledge [7], and to promote participation, interaction and most importantly, learning. This model reduces dependability on faculty expertise in a higher education institute by collecting the best of information out of the knowledge apprehended by the faculty and hence improves the level of information imparted or shared to the students. The study focuses on entire academic roles of a faculty to the students as well as the administration. The key concept behind this research is to create a tool for collaborative learning methodology initiating high impact teaching.

Using code-coverage analysis, you can then create additional test cases to increase coverage and determine a quantitative measure of code coverage, which is an indirect measure of the quality of your software. It quantifies the degree of verification completeness. It also allows the designer, who designs test cases, to identify possible bugs or redundant code thus speeding verification. In this project, we are showing the implementation of Object Oriented Byte Code Testing tool for testing Object Oriented Programs. In this tool, no source code is required except Byte code. This tool executes a Test benchmark file, which consists of test cases, to measure the percentage of the code covered.

The host performance in terms of colonization and spore production was compared with two annual hosts. The mycorrhizal dependency and growth enhancement potential were analyzed to test the suitability of D. strictus as a host plant. After 90 days of growth, 77.2% roots of D. strictus were found to be colonized by AM fungi with a spore count of 7 per g soil. AM fungal colonization and spore density values were lower in case of the host plants tested. Growth of D. strictus plants was found to be enhanced, in terms of all studied parameters; significant increases were recorded in shoot length as well as fresh and dry weight of shoots, a part of commercial importance. Similarly, P content, protein concentration, chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b contents were found to increase significantly. These data suggest that D. strictus can be used for the multiplication of AM fungi, isolated originally from the rhizosphere of tea; simultaneously, higher shoot biomass can provide additional economic benefit, using this environment friendly technology.</div></div>', 'author': 'Shipra Singh and Ajay Kumar and Anita Pandey and Lok Man S Palni', 'eprint': 'http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/isrn.soil.science/2012/607213.pdf', 'journal': 'ISRN Soil Science', 'publisher': 'Hindawi Publishing Corporation', 'title': 'Dendrocalamus strictus ((Roxb.)

Secure localization has thus become a serious issue due to increasing security threats in wireless sensor networks. In this paper, we address the problem of making sensors in WSNs locate their positions in an environment in which there exists the threat of wormhole attacks. We propose a distance vector (DV)-based robust localization (DVRL) scheme which can fight against wormhole attacks in wireless sensors networks without increasing hardware complexity or incurring too much computational cost. In DVRL, sensors estimate the position relationship between each other by the distance vector (DV) and ensure the security of their localization by using an effective detection mechanism, which can enhance the robustness of the localization method. Experiment results show that the proposed scheme is capable of fighting against wormhole attacks while improving accuracy compared to the basic DV-Hop algorithm.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'ANATHA KUMAR and SMTK KAVITHA and G NAGESWARARAO', 'eprint': 'https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/38dc/aa2ca7935d612f4cc28bff45d6a30e80b11b.pdf', 'title': 'DV-based Robust Localization against Wormhole Attacks in Wireless Sensor Networks', 'url': 'https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/38dc/aa2ca7935d612f4cc28bff45d6a30e80b11b.pdf', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:-QO_JlXAMEAC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">We present an approach to find the edge congestion sum and dilation sum forembedding of cycle on n vertices, into hypercube.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Vijender Kumar and Anil Kumar', 'eprint': 'http://ijiet.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/11.pdf', 'title': 'Embedding of Cycles into Hypercube', 'url': 'http://ijiet.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/11.pdf', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:85sL7E1SSRcC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'author': 'Alexandra Niessen-Ruenzi and Alok Kumar and Oliver G Spalt', 'title': 'What is in a Name?

Campylobacter are considered to be most common causative agents of foodborne bacterial gastroenteritis and nearly, 90% of human Campylobacter infections are attributed to C. jejuni. The high prevalence of C. jejuni and its rare potential fatal sequelaes like Guillain Barre Syndrome, Miller Fisher Syndrome, and Reactive Arthritis have attracted considerable research interest. Efforts to reduce C. jejuni infection in humans are directly linked to the better understanding of its physio-biology which inturn explore the pathogenesis mechanism in host. Despite the availability of genomic information of different strains of C. jejuni and advanced genetic tools, the complete understanding of the virulence mechanism is still an ongoing effort.

On-line techniques for measuring U and Pu concentrations in a pyroprocessing system are not presently available. Thus, a radiation detector is needed that can operate inside of the reprocessing tank and for which the detector output can be used to calculate the concentrations of U and Pu[1] in the salt. 4 H-SiC Schottky diode detectors can potentially fulfill this need.

Quality and productivity are two important but contradicting aspects of any manufacturing/ production process. Moreover, product quality is generally assessed by multiple indices. It is therefore, often required to optimize multiple quality features in order to determine the most favourable process environment before the product is subjected to undergo for mass production. Taguchi’s philosophy provides a trade-off between quality loss and productivity by engineering judgment. However, it fails to solve multi-objective optimization problem. In this context, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) can be applied as the means for converting multi-objectives into an equivalent single response; which can easily be optimized using Taguchi method. Application feasibility of proposed DEA based Taguchi method has been illustrated through a case study in which nylon have been machined using various process parameters (viz. cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut) for optimizing material removal rate (MRR) and multiple surface roughness parameters of statistical importance.</div></div>', 'author': 'A Kumar and Jambeswar Sahu and Saurav Datta and Siba Sankar Mahapatra', 'eprint': 'http://dspace.nitrkl.ac.in/dspace/bitstream/2080/1629/1/NASOME12-CP04.pdf', 'title': 'Dea Based Taguchi Approach for Multi-Objective Optimization in Machining Polymers: A Case Study', 'url': 'http://dspace.nitrkl.ac.in/dspace/handle/2080/1629', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:5Hlrm_bZEgcC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">There are significant progress over the last few years in low energy nonperturbative regime of QCD.

The causes for this decline in India can be attributed to the facts like underdeveloped infrastructure facilities, poor quality of services and socio-cultural stigmas associated with public transport. Over the last few years, Government of India has been involved in a process of deep transformation of public transport through different policy initiatives to attract more and more commuters towards using public transport. Providing a good service quality to meet passengers’ needs is the key to retaining existing passengers as well as attracting new ones who currently use other modes of transport. It is one of the important practical themes for service providers and regulatory agencies, but it also continues to be a challenging research theme. In the present paper researchers address the service quality issues of public transport in India; challenges in measuring service quality; and different dimensions used by researchers to measure service quality of public transport in the backdrop of Government of India initiatives towards improving the state of public transport system. The researchers have attempted to draw out a conceptual framework which can be further tested empirically in different Indian cities to arrive at an effective service quality measurement scale.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Ashutosh Kumar', 'journal': 'Available at SSRN 2606877', 'title': 'Measuring Service Quality in Indian Public Transport System: A Comprehensive Review', 'url': 'https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2606877', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:zBCjByih94YC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">The development of an organism is accompanied by various cellular morphogenetic movements, changes in cellular as well as nuclear morphology and transcription programs. Recent evidence suggests that intra and inter-cellular connections mediated by various adhesion proteins contribute to defining nuclear morphology. In addition, three dimensional organization of the cell nucleus regulate the transcription programs. However the link between cellular morphogenetic movements and its coupling to nuclear function in a developmental context is poorly understood. In this paper we use a point perturbation by tissue level laser ablation and sheet perturbation by application of force using magnetic tweezers to alter cellular morphogenetic movements and probe its impact on nuclear morphology and segmental gene expression patterns. Mechanical perturbations during blastoderm stage in a developing Drosophila embryo resulted in localized alterations in nuclear morphology and cellular movement. In addition, global defects in germ-band (GB) extension and retraction are observed when external force is applied during morphogenetic movements, suggesting a long-range physical coupling within the GB layer of cells. Further local application of force resulted in redistribution of non muscle myosin-II in the GB layer. Finally these perturbations lead to altered segmental gene (engrailed) expression patterns later during the development. Our observations suggest that there exists a tight regulation between nuclear morphology and cellular adhesive connections during morphogenetic movement of cells in the embryo.

The first type of errors are the most annoying but can be concealed exploiting the signal spatial correlation like in a number of techniques proposed in the past; the second are less annoying but more difficult to address; the latter are often imperceptible. In this paper, we address the problem of concealing the errors when planes are damaged by proposing a new approach This problem has been overcome by applying an adaptive solution, which exploits an edge map to choose the optimal filter mask size. Simulation results demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed approach. Our approach exploits the fact that only a fraction of JPEG code space is actually used by available encoders. Data embedding is performed by mapping a used variable length code (VLC) to an unused VLC. However, standard viewers unaware of the change will not properly display the image. We address this problem by a novel error concealment technique. Concealment works by remapping run/size values of marked VLCs so that standard viewers do not lose synchronization and displays the image with minimum loss of quality. It is possible for the embedded image to be visually identical to the original even though the two files are bitwise different. The algorithm is fast and transparent and embedding is reversible and file-size preserving. Under certain circumstances, file size may actually decrease despite carrying a payload.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Abhishek Kumar and Swapnil Isod and Shailesh N Sisat and Vishwajit K Barbudhe', 'eprint': 'http://www.ijecscse.org/papers/Dec%202012/Image%20Error%20Concealment%20for%20JPEG%20and%20PICT%20Format.pdf', 'journal': 'International Journal of Electronics, Communication and Soft Computing Science & Engineering (IJECSCSE)', 'number': '4', 'pages': '11', 'publisher': 'International Journal of Electronics, Communication and Soft Computing Science and Engineering', 'title': 'Image Error-Concealment for JPEG & PICT Format', 'url': 'http://www.ijecscse.org/papers/Dec%202012/Image%20Error%20Concealment%20for%20JPEG%20and%20PICT%20Format.pdf', 'volume': '2', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:EPG8bYD4jVwC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'author': 'SK Shrivastava and A Kumar and V Prakash', 'journal': 'Geobios-International Journal of Life Sciences', 'number': '2', 'pages': '129', 'title': 'Changing patterns of Phytodiversity of Yamuna Flood plain Flora at Agra', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16347033126556433285&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'volume': '39', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:uVUOdF_882EC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small">Species-specific PCR technique targeting the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene was used for cattle meat identification.

The main objective of this work is to develop a generalized tool path generation algorithm to machine the parts having parametric surface. The proposed algorithm has a capable of generating reliable and near optimal tool paths including cutter location file for the part being manufactured. The algorithm is having two modules, the first module is the forward-step function, which is independent of the surface type and is applicable to all continuous parametric surfaces that are twice differentiable. The second module is the side step function and it is capable of generating the cutter contact points by maintaining given tolerance and scallop height in the tool paths. Several parts, for which the cutter contact points are obtained from above algorithm, are machined using a three-axes milling machine.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'M Venkatesh and D Sreeramulu and A Satish Kumar', 'eprint': 'http://search.proquest.com/openview/4cd41c02a9e579de4bac0d169838ccea/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=2034833', 'journal': 'Journal of Mechatronics and Intelligent Manufacturing', 'number': '3/4', 'pages': '143', 'publisher': 'Nova Science Publishers, Inc.', 'title': 'AUTOMATIC TOOL PATH GENERATION FOR FREEFORM SURFACES USING B-SPLINE TECHNIQUE', 'url': 'http://search.proquest.com/openview/4cd41c02a9e579de4bac0d169838ccea/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=2034833', 'volume': '2', 'year': 2011}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:yMeIxYmEMEAC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">India can justifiably claim to be a success story in so far as the telecom sector is concerned.

It makes use of a pair of keys, namely the public key and the private key. It may be used for both secrecy and digital signatures and its security is based on the intractability of the integer factorization problem. RSA algorithm has an intricate connection with the number theory of mathematics. The Fermat’s theorem, Fundamental theorem, Euler’s theorem, Euler’s Totient function, Chinese Remainder theorem, etc. are used in RSA algorithm. RSA algorithm is a discipline of cryptography which is used for making the network secure. The intricacies of RSA and its characteristics like security issues, computational aspects make it the most sought after asymmetric key algorithm till date. In order to overcome the deficiencies in the original RSA many variants have been proposed which include RSA-CRT, rebalanced RSA, dual RSA, multi-prime RSA and multi-power RSA. This thesis presents an insight into the basics of cryptography and different types of cryptography. It describes RSA and explores its intricacies and its characteristics. It even illustrates in general the different variants of the RSA algorithm and presents various comparisons among them on the basis of complexity and security. It also describes the shortcomings in implementation like the flaws in security and functionality which have occurred in the RSA algorithms implemented so far. It portrays that much work can be done on RSA. In particular, the work discussed in this thesis is about the implementation of multi-prime and multi-power RSA on 2048-bits.

The SCUBE3 gene encodes for a polypeptide of 993 amino acids and the protein domain structure is composed of at least five motifs: an N-terminal signal peptide sequence, nine copies of EGF (epidermal growth factor)–like repeats, a spacer region followed by three repeated cysteine-rich domains and one CUB (complement proteins C1r/C1s, Uegf, and Bmp1) domain at C-terminus. SCUBE3 is not only expressed in vascular endothelial cells but also in osteoblasts and cardiac tissue. It has been reported that transgenic over-expression of SCUBE3 in the heart could stabilize the TGF-β1 signaling through releasing the EFG-like repeats from the CUB domain, and lead to cardiac hypertrophic response in murine model (2). Our previous study showed that SCUBE3 mRNA was up-regulated in highly invasive lung cancer cell lines and in patients with poor prognosis. These results prompt us to pursue the biological functions of SCUBE3 in lung cancer progression.

In the absence of an adequate and an equitable financing mechanism for financing the rising health care costs, the poor would be largely excluded from accessing and availing of in-patient health care. The National health insurance scheme for the below poverty line families (RSBY) holds promise as a good attempt to bridge this gap. However, despite several excellent features, there are several areas of concern, which if left unchecked have the potential of derailing the scheme.

For example, the variation may be such that the tip of the electric field vector may move on a line, on a circle, or, in general, on an ellipse.

Among these fission products, 137 Cs is of special concern, because with 90 Sr, it constitutes a major source of heat in the waste. This radionuclide has long half-life and biological hazards. So, its removal from the waste streams, before discharge to the environment, is necessary. A variety of methods, such as liquid/liquid extraction, solid/liquid extraction, ion-exchange processes, etc., have been proposed for the recovery/removal of 137 Cs from nuclear waste.

The disease is caused by serotype 1 of IBD virus (IBDV) belonging to genus Avibirnavirus of family Birnaviridae. One of the most probable reasons for frequent vaccination failures is attributed to emergence of variant or very virulent strains. Hence the present study was carried out in an attempt to characterize the chicken embryo fibroblast culture (CEF) adapted IBD isolates which was originally characterized as very virulent in nature at molecular level. Amplification of 248 bp hyper variable region of VP2 gene was done by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using specific primers with RNA isolated from CEF culture infected with these field isolates. Though sequence and phylogenetic analysis of 248 bp RT-PCR product indicate that these field isolates are closely related to very virulent strains of virus there is change in nucleotide and amino acid sequences from virulent one which may be is due to cell adaption. However, further studies such as challenge studies, complete genome sequence analysis and site directed mutagenesis and reverse genetics approach will throw more light on correlation between genotypes and antigenic subtypes and pathotypes.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'A Kumar and V Umapathi', 'eprint': 'https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6312/a0c7bd378e98da608ff3d3d56e64176929d4.pdf', 'title': 'Sequence analysis of a part of hypervariable region of VP2 gene of chicken embryo fibroblast adapted Infectious Bursal Disease virus isolates of Uttarakhand', 'url': 'https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6312/a0c7bd378e98da608ff3d3d56e64176929d4.pdf', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:jG_sDXCMgAMC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">In the present studies, some seven and ten coordinated complexes of trivalent lanthanides derived from 4 [N-(4’-dimethylaminobenzalidene) amino] antipyrinethiosemicarbazone (DMBAAPTS) and pyridine are reported with the general composition LnX3. n (DMABAAPTS).

The infrared studies suggest that the DMBAAPTS behaves as a neutral tridentate (N, N, S) while pyridine is coordinated to central metal ion via its lone N-atom. Perchlorate ions are not coordinated in coordination sphere; nitrates are bicovalently bonded, while isothiocyanate is coordinated through a strong N-atom. From electronic spectral data, nephelauxetic effect (β), covalence factor (b1/2), Sinha parameter (δ%) and the covalence angular overlap parameter (η) have been calculated.

Back Image data was acquired using automated template matching of a pegboard in a unique stereo camera configuration that improves speed over existing processes. To improve the registration process, a new approach combining image segmentation and differential geometry with belief propagation was developed. Stray data points were removed in the 3D Back image reconstruction process and missing data points were interpolated using a unique method of Moving Least Squares– Bezier Curve. The procedure was tested on human subjects. The results demonstrate that the procedure can be used clinically to obtain 3D back images for the evaluation of scoliosis.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Anish Kumar', 'eprint': 'https://era.library.ualberta.ca/items/2bf143ee-75b1-4174-ba34-108660e1115b/view/fc92761b-27c5-41a3-b29a-8ab4a3b5fdb6/Kumar_Anish_Fall-202011.pdf', 'title': 'Novel 3D Back Reconstruction using Stereo Digital Cameras', 'url': 'https://era.library.ualberta.ca/items/2bf143ee-75b1-4174-ba34-108660e1115b', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:5XSfyxoPzb8C', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Outbreaks associated with consumption of either Campylobacter contaminated raw milk or contaminated milk after treatment, were previously recorded in the US.

These elements can be found, in trace amounts, in almost all soils and rocks. Being a gas, radon can escape from mineral surfaces and dissolve in ground water, which can carry it away from its point of origin. We rarely find radon in significant concentrations in surface waters, due to its rapid dispersal into the atmosphere. Typical groundwater sources average between 200 and 600 pCi/L of radon. Roughly 10 percent of public drinking water supplies have concentrations of over 1000 pCi/L, and around 1 percent exceed 10,000 pCi/L. Smaller water systems appear to be disproportionally affected by high concentration of radon.

As a consequence, at low rotational frequency, the nuclear shape is strongly influenced by the valence quasiparticles. At higher frequencies, the alignment of quasiparticles pairs introduces an additional driving force that can significantly change the nuclear shape. In addition, strong γ-driving forces are expected for quasiparticles in high-j orbitals which have deep energy minima at specific value of γ, dependent upon where the Fermi surface lies within the high-j shell. In this mass region, lower mid-shell h11/2 protons (derived from low-Ω orbitals) favour prolate nuclear shapes (γ= 0) while upper-midshell h11/2 neutrons (derived from high-Ω orbitals) favours shape close to oblate shape (γ=-60). The rotational alignment of upper-midshell h11/2 neutrons can thus induce a shape change for γsoft cores driving them toward a collectivelyrotating oblate shape. The neutron number N= 75 lies in a γ-soft region intermediate between prolate (N≤ 74) and triaxial (N≥ 76) shapes. The active proton orbitals for these nuclei are the unique parity intruder h11/2, d5/2, g7/2, and the extruder g9/2. Moreover, because of the different shape driving effect for proton and neutrons, many of the nuclei in this region are triaxial which leads to a band structure with novel angular momentum coupling schemes like chiral bands and magnetic rotational bands.

Earlier efforts to improve yield under drought concentrated on selection for secondary traits in early generations and testing for yield under drought in advanced stage has not yielded satisfactory yield increase under drought. Early generation selection has been suggested to have more chance to allow favorable alleles to accumulate much faster before the population size has been reduce and while variability is still high allowing yield increase under drought. In the present study, F2 generation selection under drought and irrigated control for grain yield on two populations. N22/2* Swarna and N22/2* Sambha Mahsuri were carried in DS [dry season] 2009. Selected plants were advanced and evaluated for yield potential in 2009 WS [wet season]. Finally, a total of 50 lines selected from each population were evaluated in 2010 DS under both control and drought conditions. Results showed that lines advanced through selection under drought yielded higher under drought with no yield penalty under irrigated control condition.

If suspicion is raised, then this goal is defeated. Discovering and rendering useless such covert messages is a new art form known as steganalysis.

The trade direction (buy versus sell orders) and the duration between trades are modeled jointly. The model allows the Probabilities of Good News and Bad News to vary each interval. Results show that intraday patterns of the PIN estimates are consistent with the scheduled arrival of public information or news. Further, we show that PIN is positively related to overall market depth. The effect of realized volatility on information asymmetry is unexpectedly found to be negative.

We engineered the molecular design to suppress excited-state quenching from metal substrates and to form rigid assemblies of single tethered azobenezene molecules in the domains of the monolayer to limit steric constraints, and tip-induced and stochastic switching effects. We prepared one-dimensional chain assemblies of azobenzene-functionalized molecules in the domain boundaries of n-alkanethiol matrices. We switched the chains of molecules from trans to cis using UV light and observed that the molecules in the chains isomerize in concert. This concerted switching was attributed to electronic coupling between the molecules within the chains. We employed electron-induced isomerization of azobenzene in the chains and established that &amp;# 960; orbital overlap of the molecules in the one-dimensional chain structures enables the electrons to delocalize along the chain.

Several recent experimental studies [1-3] reported that the light charged particles and n-spectra from mass symmetric projectile-target systems show significant deviations from predicted conventional statistical model evaporation spectra. In general, it is also accepted that at high excitation energy, fusion hindrance do take place due to dynamical effects, fusion and fission time scales are altered by such effects. The analysis of vast amount of data obtained from the measurements of pre-scission neutron multiplicity, GDR gamma ray and evaporation residue clearly suggest that the time scale for fission process is hindered due to dynamical effects such as nuclear viscosity [5]. Such hindrance can also take place for the fusion of the medium mass nuclei. In some of the analysis of the alpha, proton and neutron spectra [2, 4] it was found that statistical model calculations performed using the l-distribution (or lgraz) obtained by Bass-systematics under-predicts the alpha and proton spectra and over-predicts the neutron spectra obtained through the fusion of mass symmetric entrance channel.

With an aggregate investment of trillion dollars in India, the investing public’s interest in identifying successful fund managers is understandable. From an academic perspective, the goal of identifying superior fund managers is interesting as it encourages development and application of new models and theories. The idea behind performance evaluation is to find the returns provided by the individual schemes especially growth funds and the risk levels at which they are delivered in comparison with the market and the risk free rates. It is also our aim to identify the out-performers for healthy investments. We have also ranked the investment opportunities for better evaluation of these funds based on various adjusted ratios like Sharpe ratio, Jensen Measure, Fama ratio, Sortino ratio, Treynor’s ratio and few others. Financial literature has very little studies which concentrate on multiple measures of mutual fund performance evaluation. Therefore, an attempt has been made to capture the critical measures of performance evaluation of mutual funds.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Ravi Agarwal and Jyoti Dabas and Vignesh Ramakrishnan and Aditi Kumar', 'journal': 'International Conference on Banking and Finance', 'title': 'Performance Evaluation of Mutual Funds (Growth Funds) in India: An In-Depth Risk Return Analysis', 'url': 'https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm?abstractid=1537074', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:MhMRrlfrL94C', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr">DI-fusion, le Dépôt institutionnel numérique de l\'ULB, est l\'outil de référencementde la\nproduction scientifique de l\'ULB.L\'interface de recherche DI-fusion permet de consulter les\npublications des chercheurs de l\'ULB et les thèses qui y ont été défendues.\n</div>', 'author': 'Daniel De Backer and Patrick Biston and Jean Louis Vincent', 'journal': 'The New England journal of medicine', 'number': '24', 'pages': '2331', 'title': 'Comparison of dopamine and norepinephrine in shock', 'url': 'http://difusion.ulb.ac.be/vufind/Record/ULB-DIPOT:oai:dipot.ulb.ac.be:2013/99592/Home', 'volume': '362', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:C1EYyJaxJZIC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">[en] Full text: Nanosized ferrites with uniform particle size and narrow size distribution are desirable for a variety of applications viz. sensors, targeted drug delivery, ferrofluids, medical imaging and biomedical applications, magnetic data storage etc. In the present investigations, nanocrystalline samples of gadolinium substituted NiZn ferrite with composition Ni 0.5 Zn 0.5 Gd x Fe 2-x O 4 (where x= 0.1, 0.2, 0.3) were synthesized by co-precipitation technique.

Mobile Internet protocol [1, 2] has been designed within the IETF to support the mobility [2] of users who wish to connect to the internet and maintain communications as they move from place to place. Mobile IPV6 allows a mobile node to talk directly to its peers while retaining the ability to move around and change the currently used IP addresses. This mode of operation is called Route Optimization [7, 10]. In this approach, the correspondent node learns a binding between the Mobile nodes permanent home address and its current temporary care-of-address. This introduces several security vulnerabilities to Mobile IP, among them the most important one is the authentication and authorization of binding updates. This paper describes the Route optimization by the introduction of mobility. In this paper, we proposed a new efficient technique for route optimization in mobile IP for smoothly communication while MN moving from one network domain to other without losing the connection. Our technique will also be improve the path in intra-network communication [9].</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Sumit Kumar and Anil Kumar and Vinay Kumar Nigam and Rakesh Kumar', 'eprint': 'https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e50a/b287bb578f468d1402041fccf7392b0c4dc0.pdf', 'journal': 'Indian Journal of Computer Science and Engineering', 'number': '4', 'pages': '313-320', 'title': 'Perceptive approach for route optimization in mobile ip', 'url': 'https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e50a/b287bb578f468d1402041fccf7392b0c4dc0.pdf', 'volume': '1', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:lvi_KyGYEDoC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Agrosafe RG, a neem-based oil formulation was tested against red spider mite under laboratory and field conditions.

Sweet sorghum cultivation is feasible and profitable under rainfed conditions in the study area with the hybrid CSH 22 SS. Results from on-farm evaluation of elite sweet sorghum hybrids and varieties and correlation studies indicated that dryland farmers gain from whole plant use of sweet sorghum as there is no significant tradeoff between grain yield and sugar/stover yields.

It was only few years ago the factual character of Trichoderma has been recognized. Pioneers in Trichoderma like Rifai (1969) and Bissett (1991a-c) observed certain cultural characters that could be used for identification and description of these species viz, tuft or cushion of hyphae on natural substrate composed of conidiophores, spores and some sterile hyphae, conidiophores indefinite, branched or unbranched hyphae bearing phialides laterally or terminally, phialides oust by heads rarely short or in chains, spore hyaline or brightly coloured, one celled. Nonetheless, class affinities of the genus for the development of species are still very slow. Rifai (1969) classified the Trichoderma into nine species aggregates, further it was elaborated by Bissett (1984, 1991a-c, 1992), covering thirty-five species, their classification reflected the importance of microscopic characters for delimiting the Trichoderma species.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Sharma Pratibha and AM Kumar and M Henry', 'journal': 'Molecular biology of plant pathogens', 'pages': '302-335', 'publisher': 'Daya Publishing House', 'title': 'Characterization of Trichoderma spp.', 'url': 'https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103301121', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:TuM7UPshZo8C', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'author': 'A Kumar and R Garg', 'pages': '76-77', 'publisher': 'CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS', 'title': 'Effect of citalopram and desipramine against sleep deprivation-induced anxiety like-behavior alterations and oxidative damage in mice', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7965300417425591397&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'volume': '13', 'year': 2010}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:oE_QS-WwsdAC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">In this article, thermal performance of copper and brass immersion rods fitted inside aluminum pots has been compared on the basis of the values of convective heat transfer coefficients evaluated during evaporation of sugarcane juice for jaggery production.

The rationale is that the firm’s cost of interacting with customers through web based channel is an order of magnitude cheaper than the assisted channels like telephony. However, the interaction among competing channels of customer service at call center is not empirically validated so far. We conduct a field study at the call center of a prominent US health insurance firm to examine the cost saving rationale of web based self service. On one hand, the low cost-low quality web channel may substitute high cost-high quality telephony channel in some cases. Interestingly on the other hand, the web also exposes customers to more information that at times aggravates their concerns and thus leads to more telephone calls. We designed a quasi-natural experiment in our field setting and used diff-in-diff specifications to show that web based self service usage leads to 14% increase in telephone calls. We conduct several checks to show that our specifications are robust to any potential selection of customers in web self-service usage. However, we further show that the impact of web portal is moderated by the web portal characteristics and individual customer characteristics. We find that if information is unambiguous and easily retrievable on web, calls in respect to such information go down by 29%. Likewise, we also find that the absolute increase in calls due to web usage for younger customers (age&lt; 40 years) and older customers (age&gt; 60years) are much higher than the middle aged customers (age 40-60 years).

Recent advances in communication technologies have the capacity for addressing many of the challenges identified with rural and remote social work practice, such as scarcity of professional resources, professional isolation and limited access to supervision and professional development. Communication has been seen by a large number of development planners as a panacea for solving major social ills and problems. Apart from development, the introduction of communication in the educational process for open and distance learning is seen as step towards improving the quality of education and bridging the social and educational gap. One of the major components and driving force of rural development is communication. Conventionally, communication includes electronic media, human communication and now Information Technology (IT). Communication technology is always expressions of socio-economic, geographical and political interests, partialities, alignments and commitments.

A 96 hour forecast produced westerly winds at 500 hPa level that were too weak over north-central India, which caused the model cyclone track to drift from the observed track.

Evaluation of impact of cervix soft tissue matching for management of cervix motion.</div><div class="gsh_csp">Methods and Materials: Ten patients with stage IIB-IVA cervical cancer underwent daily MVCT imaging. Interfractional organ motion was evaluated on 150 pre-treatment MVCT images by measuring shifts in their boundaries between the MVCT and planning kV CT scan in the anteroposterior (AP), laterolateral (LL) and superoinferior (SI) directions. Intrafractional patient movement was evaluated on 50 post-treatment MVCT images. Additional cervix soft tissue matching was performed for cervix alignment and impact of image-guidance on CTV-PTV margin was evaluated. Results: Measured cervical motion (mean±SD) was 0.4±10.1 mm in anterior,− 3.0±6.9 mm in posterior direction,− 3.5±6.9 mm in left and 0.2±4.5 mm in right lateral direction, 2.2±8.0 mm in superior and 0.5±5.0 mm in inferior direction. Compared to the cervix, larger uterine motion was observed. Patient movement during treatment was limited to 1.1±1.25 mm,− 0.26±1.56 mm, and 0.22±2.26 mm in AP, LL and SI direction respectively. Cervical alignment asked mean additional manual adaptation of 1.1±9.5 mm in anterior, 0.8±6.5 mm in posterior and 0.9±5.9 mm in lateral direction.

This has resulted in a spurt of writings that focus on re-visioning and re-living the themes once paramount among the writers of the canon. This paper highlights one such approach adopted by Gloria Naylor, a very pronounced name in the contemporary African-American Literature, in her novel Mama Day. By revising the story of Shakespeare\'s The Tempest and replacing the male-centered approach of Shakespeare, Naylor has given a different orientation to the whole story. Rather than celebrating the male and white superiority with Prospero at the center, she aligns herself with the marginalized, the underprivileged, and the underdogs.

The mechanism (s) involved in progression of indolent to active disease remains elusive although a role for age-related increase in oxidative stress has been proposed. There are a variety of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that ultimately cause oxidative stress and any particular oxidant has not been identified as being primarily involved. We rationalized that a combination of antioxidants may be necessary to neutralize the different classes of ROS to prevent the progression of latent precursor foci to active cancer.

The flexible joints are usually designed to allow the riser to rotate with the floating structure motion and reduce the amount of moments transferred to the hull structure. The flexible joints depend on the flexibility and compressibility of the elastomer layers to allow for the rotation of the SCR. The stress joints, alternatively, provide fixed support at the hull and thus larger bending moment that has to be accounted for in the hull design.

At high spin states, as the proton Fermi surface lies near the bottom of the πh11/2 subshell and the neutron Fermi surface lies near the top of the ν h11/2 subshell, the rotational alignment of a pair of protons from the lower h11/2 midshell drives the nucleus to a near-prolate (γ~ 0) shape while the rotational alignment of a pair of h11/2 neutrons from the upper midshell drives the nucleus to an oblate shape near (γ~-60) Thus, the different excitations of quasiparticles may drive the nucleus to form different shapes and shape coexistence have been observed in this mass region. A particularly interesting scenario occurs when the occupation of shape-driving orbitals at the Fermi surface removes axial symmetry and forces the nucleus to adopt a triaxial shape. This is particularly so for the nuclei in the A~ 130 region which exhibit a softness to γ. Evidence for characteristics such as shape coexistence and γ-softness has been gathered during the last two decades for many nuclei from Xe to Nd. Another interesting feature of this mass region is the existence of a regular M1 band which has been considered to be a promising candidate for magnetic rotation. The theoretical description of magnetic rotation is given in the framework of the tilted axis cranking (TAC) model developed by Frauendorf [1]. Experimentally it was first established in the neutron deficient Pb isotopes [2, 3]. In several nuclei [4-8] of the A~ 130 mass region M1 bands like those observed in the A&lt; 200 mass region are known.

Drawing from the vertical differentiation literature in economics and human information acquisition and processing theories from psychology, we present a theoretical framework to show that both possibilities may exist (1) the web based self-service substitutes the assisted channels and (2) web based self-service leads to increase in demand for assisted channel. In our field setting, we show through a robust diff-in-diff specification that web based self service usage leads to 23% increase in telephony usage. We also use instrumental variables to account for potential selection of customers into the self service usage.

The first essay examines how idiosyncratic risk affects the cross-section of stock returns. I use an exponential GARCH model to forecast expected idiosyncratic volatility and employ a combination of the size effect, value premium, return momentum and short-term reversal to measure relative mispricing. I find that stock returns monotonically increase in idiosyncratic risk for relatively undervalued stocks and monotonically decrease in idiosyncratic risk for relatively overvalued stocks. This phenomenon is robust to various subsamples and industries, and cannot be explained by risk factors or firm characteristics. Further, transaction costs, short-sale constraints and information uncertainty cannot account for the role of idiosyncratic risk. Overall, these findings are consistent with the limits of arbitrage arguments and demonstrate the importance of idiosyncratic risk as an arbitrage cost. The second essay studies the cross-sectional determinants of delta-hedged stock option returns with an emphasis on the pricing of volatility risk. We find that the average delta-hedged option returns are significantly negative for most stocks, and they decrease monotonically with both total and idiosyncratic volatility of the underlying stock. Our results are robust and cannot be explained by the Fama-French factors, market volatility risk, jump risk, or the effect of past stock return and volatility-related option mispricing. Our results strongly support a negative market price of volatility risk specification that is proportional to the volatility level. Reflecting this volatility risk premium, writing covered calls on high …</div></div>', 'author': 'Jie Cao', 'eprint': 'https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/9661/caoj03261.pdf?sequence=2', 'title': 'Two essays on the impact of idiosyncratic risk on asset returns', 'url': 'https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/9661', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:wKETBy42zhYC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">(WSNs) can be significantly improved using adaptive cooperative diversity (SCA) technique, which is basically a cross-layer design that combines truncated ARQ at the link layer and cooperative diversity at the physical layer.

This is particularly so with rural decentralisation. While the national legislations prescribe uniform laws and policies the actual implementation of the same varies among states. This article argues that unsteady policies towards rural decentralisation in Indian states require an explanation. The explanation forwarded in this article is that it is the regime types at the state level that determine the form and substance of these policies. A comparison of rural decentralisation policies in two south Indian states shows how the state level regimes have determined the policies and their implementation both before and after the 73rd Constitutional Amendment. And this article further argues that the variations in the decentralisation policy make us consider it as an iterative policy process.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Anil Kumar', 'journal': 'The Indian Journal of Political Science', 'number': '1-2', 'pages': '21', 'publisher': 'Indian Political Science Association', 'title': 'The Indian Journal of Political Science Vol. LXX, No. 1, Jan.-Mar., 2009 COMPARING RURAL DECENTRALISATION ACROSS INDIAN STATES: KARNATAKA AND ANDHRA PRADESH', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15007681543314786433&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'volume': '70', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:WqliGbK-hY8C', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small">This paper presents a medium access protocol for spread spectrum networks.

We focus on the use of the protocol in mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) to increase the throughput of the network. The existing IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol uses spread spectrum technique at the physical layer. However, it uses the same PN code for spreading all the transmitted signals. This makes it impossible for concurrent transmissions to occur in the vicinity of a receiver. We use multiple spreading codes at the physical layer to allow for the simultaneous interference-limited transmissions to take place in the vicinity of the receiver. A node gains information about ongoing transmissions in its neighborhood from the overheard control packets (RTS and CTS).

The mechanism (s) involved in progression of indolent to active disease remains elusive although a role for age-related increase in oxidative stress has been proposed. There are a variety of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that ultimately cause oxidative stress and any particular oxidant has not been identified as being primarily involved. We rationalized that a combination of antioxidants may be necessary to neutralize the different classes of ROS to prevent the progression of latent precursor foci to active cancer. Therefore we devised a combination of antioxidants with varied antioxidant properties to determine whether such supplementation could prevent the progression of PIN in Noble rats that are stimulated to develop PIN with hormones. Results from this study show for the first time that dietary intervention with a combination of antioxidants caused a significant decrease (p 0.04) in high grade PIN formation compared to animals on control diet. Levels of p65 (a component of NF B), Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Cox-2 were elevated in the prostate from hormone-stimulated rats. These data provide evidence regarding the involvement of oxidants in the progression of precursor lesions and the need to evaluate combinations of antioxidants as prostate cancer preventive agents.</div><div class="gsh_csp">Descriptors:* PROSTATE CANCER,* STRESS …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'AP Kumar', 'eprint': 'https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a482781.pdf', 'publisher': 'TEXAS UNIV HEALTH SCIENCE CENTER AT SAN ANTONIO', 'title': 'Antioxidant Prophylaxis in the Prevention of Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia (PIN)', 'url': 'https://apps.dtic.mil/docs/citations/ADA482781', 'year': 2008}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:wZJMF1LD7PcC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Biometrics are technologies that use measurable physical,    biological or behavioral characteristics to perform identity verification or    to recognize a person through automation. This study explored perceptions and    acceptance of biometric technology by guests in hotels: Knowing what would be    needed to install the biometric device, how to maximize the synergy between    the guests and hotels toward the new technology and trying to find out about    the knowledge base, available about biometrics among hotel guests. The results    indicated that hotel guests are comfortable and already “slightly”    willing to use biometrics, perhaps due to ongoing world-wide terrorism threats    and consequently individuals may now be more sensitized to their own physical    safety. For the hotel sector, they may be able to concentrate on those processes    that are most preferred by the customer to ensure adoption.</div></div></div>', 'author': "Chieh-Heng Ko and Yao-Hsu Tsai and Shu-Li Chen and Li-Hsin Wang and A Adler and I Ajzen and B Bacheldor and M Balnaves and P Caputi and RM Bolle and JH Connell and S Pakanti and NK Ratha and AW Senior and GC Bruner and A Kumar and FD Davis and M Fishbein and I Ajzen and KE Ghorab and YH Huo and RW Ives and Y Du and DM Etter and TB Welch and LA Jackson and AK Jain and A Ross and P Jones and P Williams and D Hillier and D Comfort and J Langenderfer and S Linnhoff and R Law and F Chen and HH Lee and AM Fiore and JY Kim and YP Li and HC Murphy and D Rottet and P O'Connor and AJ Frew and SH Oh and YM Kim and CW Lee and GY Shim and MS Park and HS Jung and AJ Singh and ML Kasavana and J Stavins and J Sweat and J Hibbard and V Venkatesh and SA Brown and J Vijayan and J Wang and J Namen", 'journal': 'Biotechnology', 'number': '4', 'pages': 'pp: 381-402-pp: 381-402', 'publisher': 'orgz', 'title': 'Customer Adoption of technology-based self-service: A case study on airport self check-in service.', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13930508858133583020&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'volume': '13', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:Y38lLjnZnYwC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'author': 'A Shamim and J Rupesh and M Rajeev and KD Prasad and A Kumar', 'journal': 'IPPTA', 'number': '1', 'pages': '117', 'publisher': 'INDIAN PULP & PAPE TECHNICAL ASSSOCIATION', 'title': 'Centralized Refining System: A Step Towards The Energy Conservation', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17275176311757670474&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'volume': '20', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:0ZEOuji6PikC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">[en] Guidelines for the assessment of internal doses from monitoring suggest default measurement of uncertainties (ie lognormal scattering factor, SF) to be used for different types of monitoring data.

Sulfur can be removed from FCC gasoline by the catalytic hydrodesulfurization (HOS) process. This process, however, requires high consumption of hydrogen and significantly reduces fuel octane number due to olefin saturation. Commercial technologies such as OCTGAIN, ISAL, SCANfining, PrimeG+, COHydro, and COHOS are available, however, these are quite complex and require multistage processing in addition to higher consumption of hydrogen. In contrast, INOSORG is a single stage, low-pressure, fixed bed reactive adsorption process (for full range feed), which consumes less hydrogen.

Some of the RET techniques used involves the use of OPC, PSM and hard mask. In order to reduce the costs it is desirable to have uniform performance on shuttle masks, which can help to reduce manufacturing costs. The micro loading and macro loading are of concern to mask makers because of the varying loads being etched within the mask. It is critical to have a mask etcher that provides excellent CD uniformity, CD bias, CD linearity and etch profile in order to have image fidelity of the OPC structures as well as sustainable yields.

In the ring-ring architecture, all communication between nodes occurs using the global or local ring topology, and no subsystems receive priority handling.

Since the treatment of hypertension is done life long and many of the drugs are quite expensive, it is important to have an idea of the cost-benefit analysis. It is also important to realize that the prevention afforded by the drugs is not absolute, and one has to consider how many persons are needed to be treated and for how long to save one event or one life. This is now considered while doing a screening test for any risk factor, and acting upon them only after informed consent of the patient is taken. An example will help. Information derived from the LIFE Study2 tells us that if 1000 persons take Losartan for one year (in addition to other anti hypertensives in most cases) it saves 9.5 deaths at an individual cost of Rs. 2,500 for Losartan, only plus the cost of other drugs. A total cost of Rs. 25 lacs for treating 1000 patients for one year, for losartan only. If thought in another way 990.5 persons would have taken the drug without benefit at a personal cost of Rs. 2500 annually and this is the conceptual input, which should be ethically given to every patient before starting on this drug. Although comparison between studies is not totally possible as identical end points have not been taken, we will discuss fatalities mainly in this write-up but the other events are also very improtant though not amenable to comparison fully.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Ashok Chandra and Amit Kumar', 'journal': 'Perspectives in Hypertension', 'pages': '239', 'publisher': 'Allied Publishers', 'title': 'Treating Hypertensives: Assessing the Yield', 'url': 'http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=u4U_CQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA239&dq=info:z3yxN5iVpWsJ:scholar.google.com&ots=cHBLT17Q2V&sig=UQUIyrxA_nrmshQ8x9kuRdef9FY', 'volume': '1', 'year': 2007}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:IuYOVjjUQBMC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Introduction Quest for ideal procedure which is safe and effective with least morbidity has led to the emergence of new alternatives in the management of infantile hydrocephalus.

By employing optical interference from 180° shifted lithography  emission, PSM masks are able to enhance feature resolution at the wafer. This is particularly  important for sub-wavelength features (i.e., features with critical dimensions less than the  lithography wavelength) where line resolution can be severely degraded without such techniques.  For these PSMs, the challenge is to provide highly uniform quartz etch performance across the entire  active area of the mask for various feature sizes and local loads. Micro-loading (a.k.a.

Because skeletal muscle consists of a mixture of slow and fast muscle fibers, an ideal promoter for such application should direct efficient expression in both muscle fiber types. The genetic elements regulating expression of the fast and slow isoforms of troponin I (TnI), an abundant muscle protein, are relatively well characterized. Theoretically, a combination of vectors expressing transgenes regulated by TnIfast and TnIslow enhancers/promoters could be used to deliver strong and muscle specific transgene expression in every skeletal muscle fiber of the body. To evaluate the usefulness of the TnIfast and TnIslow enhancers/promoters for gene therapy, we have compared their strengths with the …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Marilyne Blain and Angela Kumar and Kenneth E Hastings and George Karpati and Bernard Massie and Renald Gilbert', 'eprint': 'https://www.cell.com/molecular-therapy-family/molecular-therapy/pdf/S1525-0016(06)00641-1.pdf', 'journal': 'Molecular Therapy', 'pages': 'S125', 'publisher': 'Elsevier', 'title': '327.

On the other  hand, recent reports on Cu-based metallic glass show even better mechanical proper-ties and  good  GFA. Cu-based BMG\'s may  emerge as a high strength and futuristic engineering  materials. Therefore, in this project, a few copper  based  alloy  ribbons with nominal composition Cu60ZrxTi40-x (x=0,10,20,30,40)  were prepared by AR-arc melting followed by  melt  spinning to produce amorphous ribbons. XRD and  TEM  studies revealed the amorphous nature of the  as  cast  ribbons. DSC scans indicated  exothermic  peaks  corresponding to  different cystallizations. It is observed that, (1)the glass trans-ition temperature and crystallization temperature increase (2) the mode of  crystallization  changes  from single to multiple stages, with the addition of zirconium. The activ-ation energies of the transformation were determined by kissinger\'s peak shift method. Super cooled liquid region (^Tx=Tx-Tg) has a bearing on the Zr content. Reduced glass transition temperature Trg(=Tg/Tl) of Zr containing alloys was found -0.6, a criteria for bulk metallic glass forma-tion. The maximum ultimate tensile strength (UTS) obtained for these alloy ribbons  were -1700Mpa. Results  of  these studies indicate that a few of  these  alloy  compositions can be casted as bulk rods of  high  strength  in Cu-mold. Thus this work can be  extended to  produce  copper based bulk metallic glass rods of high strength.</div></div>', 'author': 'AJ Kailath and AK Panda and RK Minz and Goutam Das and M Ghosh and A Kumar and AK Giri and B Mahato', 'publisher': 'CSIR-NML', 'title': 'Synthesis and characterisation of Copper based bulk amorphous/nanophase alloys as melt spun ribbons', 'url': 'http://eprints.nmlindia.org/6466/', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:p-RlQlBqj_YC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">[THIS PAPER IS PLAGIARIZED FROM\'Artana, KB and Ishida, K.(2003): The Determination of Optimum Ship’s Design and Power Prediction Using Spreadsheet Model, Journal of the JIME, Vol. 37, No. 6\', http://www. mesj. or. jp/mesj_e/english/pub/ap_papers/pdf/2003AP7. pdf]</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Abhijit De and Ashish Kumar', 'eprint': 'https://www.banglajol.info/index.php/JNAME/article/download/919/2247', 'journal': 'Journal of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering', 'number': '2', 'pages': '49-58', 'title': '" Opti-Marine-Ware"(Optimization of Vessel\'s Parameters through Spreadsheet Model)', 'url': 'https://www.banglajol.info/index.php/JNAME/article/view/919', 'volume': '3', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:Liyi5BL3lGIC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">This paper describes the financial modeling of an optimized portfolio with risk measured in terms of Value at Risk.

Scientists were on the search for quark, so they performed quark-search experiments, in accelerators and cosmic rays employing modern scientific equipment [1] and no concrete evidence was found, as far as the existence of a free quark. It has been advised that quark-search experiments should be made more meticulously. We know that quarks bear fractional charges, ie, 1/3-rd of elementary charge or its multiple. Being led by this idea, quite a large number of researchers conducted experiments in search of fractional-charge bearing fragments. Some evidence of projectile fragments (PFs), with large reaction cross-sections, has been reported.

After the inginious idea of Hasegawa and Tappert1, who proposed to use temporal optical solitons in a fiber-optic communication link in order to tackle the long-standing problem of fiber dispersion, the field of optical solitons has progressed rapidly. The experimental work of Mollenauer, Stolen and Gordon2 on soliton generation and propagation in an optical fiber using picosecond laser pulses immensely contributed to this new area and further accelerated its growth. Beautiful physics with added advantage of technological applications motivated physicists and technologists to look for similar phenomena in other optical systems and it led to the discovery of new types of solitonic structures with exciting properties, useful for various technological applications3-8.</div><div class="gsh_csp">The main aim here is to introduce the reader to optical solitons and their possible applications. We start with the basic concept of a temporal soliton in an optical fiber with Kerr nonlinearity. Then, we move on to a brief description of a soliton-based all-optical communication system where we focus on the practical problems encountered in a long-haul system and discuss about the ways to overcome them. Finally, we take up spatial optical solitons and discuss their properties and possible applications. In this connection, we deal with the physical concepts in detail using the minimum necessary mathematics. In general, a soliton is a localized propagating wave solution of a nonlinear dispersive or diffractive partial differential equation which preserves its shape and velocity, in a …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Ajit Kumar', 'journal': 'Guided Wave Optics: Selected Topics', 'pages': '70', 'publisher': 'Anshan Pub', 'title': 'Temporal and Spatial Optical Solitons', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1930356110649897973&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:g_UdREhPGEoC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'author': 'R Kumar and A Kumar and BK Srivastava', 'journal': 'ORIENTAL JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY', 'number': '3', 'pages': '695', 'publisher': 'ORIENTAL SCIENCE PUBLISHING CO', 'title': 'Structural investigation of polysaccharide of Opuntia coccinellifera', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15764492993081293882&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'volume': '22', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:rOcdG6UcVlcC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small">Weaned Barbari kids (24; 3–4 m old of 11.7±0.6 kg BW) randomly divided in to three equal groups were offered concentrate mixture containing either 0.29, 0.44 or 0.59% P, supplemented with 330 g pegion pea straw and 300–400 g/d berseem fodder for 120 days.

It was seen that alpha-lipoic acid may have beneficial effects in reducing blood lipid profile and fibrinogen significantly (p&lt; 0.001) while homocysteine and triglyceride were decreased insignificantly (p&gt; 0.05). Observation strongly suggests that alpha lipoic-acid may have beneficial effects in reducing both old and new risk markers in coronary heart disease patients.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'SK Singh and A Kumar and N Singh and HV Singh and P Sharma', 'eprint': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Harsh_Singh/publication/237270238_Biochemical_status_of_various_risk_factors_of_coronary_heart_disease_pa-_tients_after_the_supplementation_of_alpha_lipoic_acid/links/54fb37010cf2c3f524204665/Biochemical-status-of-various-risk-factors-of-coronary-heart-disease-pa-tients-after-the-supplementation-of-alpha-lipoic-acid.pdf', 'journal': 'Biomedical Research', 'number': '2', 'pages': '107-109', 'title': 'Biochemical status of various risk factors of coronary heart disease pa-tients after the supplementation of alpha lipoic acid', 'url': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Harsh_Singh/publication/237270238_Biochemical_status_of_various_risk_factors_of_coronary_heart_disease_pa-_tients_after_the_supplementation_of_alpha_lipoic_acid/links/54fb37010cf2c3f524204665/Biochemical-status-of-various-risk-factors-of-coronary-heart-disease-pa-tients-after-the-supplementation-of-alpha-lipoic-acid.pdf', 'volume': '16', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:pzedKLaGEyUC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">[en] A P-channel MOSFET chip has been designed for detection of gamma radiations.

Experimental results show that our proposed methodology, when employed on popular benchmark circuits, leads to up to 14% reduction in depth when compared with the DAG-map algorithm, along with comparable reduction in area.</div></div>', 'author': 'A Manoj Kumar and B Jayaram and R Manimegalai and V Kamakoti', 'eprint': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/9132/28950/01303140.pdf', 'pages': '152', 'publisher': 'IEEE', 'title': 'MemMap-pd: performance driven technology mapping algorithm for FPGAs with embedded memory arrays', 'url': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1303140/', 'year': 2004}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:wsDUewC2rQsC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small">The compound nucleus 76Kr* was populated at the excitation energy of 75 MeV and angular momentum of 39 ℏ in fusion reactions with two complementary, mass‐symmetric (31P+45Sc) and mass asymmetric (12C+64Zn) entrance channels. The neutron evaporation spectra were measured and compared with the predictions of the statistical model calculations. The results for the mass‐asymmetric reaction are found to be consistent with the predictions of the statistical model calculations. However, for the mass‐symmetric reaction (31P+45Sc), the experimental spectra are found to be harder than the theoretical neutron spectra. The dynamical model calculations of Feldmeier show that the formation time for the compound nucleus for the symmetric system is relatively larger as compared to the asymmetric system.</div></div>', 'author': 'Ajay Kumar and A Kumar and G Singh and Hardev Singh and RP Singh and Rakesh Kumar and KS Golda and SK Datta and IM Govil', 'eprint': 'https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.1737146', 'journal': 'AIP Conference Proceedings', 'number': '1', 'pages': '501-506', 'publisher': 'AIP', 'title': 'Neutron evaporation as a probe for dynamical effects in heavy ion fusion reactions', 'url': 'https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.1737146', 'volume': '704', 'year': 2004}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:x78xNeCKx3UC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr">You may be trying to access this site from a secured browser on the server.

The present findings suggest that sustained efforts are required to Improve rational prescribing and dispensing practices, as considerable scope to improve further health status of patients as well as economic status of the health center existed.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'A Kaushal and A Kumar and SK Kulkarni and R Uppal', 'journal': 'Indian journal of pharmaceutical sciences', 'number': '6', 'pages': '617-619', 'publisher': 'MedKnow Publications and Media', 'title': 'Rational use of drugs through prescription monitoring.(Part II): A follow-up study', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15248114552645058642&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'volume': '65', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:RW1BPcyHXiwC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'author': 'SD Sharma and A Kumar and AK Sharma', 'journal': 'ACTA CIENCIA INDICA MATHEMATICS', 'number': '3', 'pages': '527-534', 'publisher': 'PRAGATI PRAKASHAN MEERUT', 'title': 'Distributional two-dimension finite mathieu transforms', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12455664695730523663&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'volume': '29', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:RF4BjkDOTHkC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'author': 'RL Ownby and D Perdomo and S Czaja and J Lewis and M Rubert and A Kumar and M Kumar and C Eisdorfer', 'pages': '235-235', 'publisher': 'SPRINGER PUBLISHING CO', 'title': "Telephone-based support for Alzheimer's caregivers reduces cortisol levels", 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11285865729939722570&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'volume': '15', 'year': 2003}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:A1VvXmYcXXgC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'author': 'R Kumar and A Kumar and N Kumar and KN Jha', 'journal': 'MATHEMATICS EDUCATION-INDIA-', 'number': '3', 'pages': '164-166', 'publisher': 'SIWAN (BIHAR)', 'title': 'On existence properties of reverse recursion theory', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9872616020208524387&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'volume': '37', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:yeKNu01O_4gC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">The ever-expanding pollution and consequently increasing pressure on food production demand high agricultural productivity, concurrent with adequate increase in crop yield by use of fertilizers and protection of crops from damaging insect pest and diseases. Ambitious use of synthetic agrochemicals in ecosystem caused variety of deleterious effects to the environment and human health. Inefficient uptake of applied fertilizers resulted in the hardening of soil thereby making it less productive. Leaching of pesticides to groundwater or nearby rivers, simultaneous non-selective killing of pest, accidents with toxic pesticides, pesticide residues of food crops and the disappearance of certain vertebrates have become more or less synonymous with modern intensive agriculture. The problem of hazardous consequences of the use of synthetic agrochemicals may be solved effectively by developing and practising fertilizers and pesticides of biological origin. Use of bioagrochemicals in agro-ecosystem is now emerging as one of the prime device to increase agricultural productivity and to protect crops from insect pest and diseases in an eco-friendly manner. Bioagrochemicals are being preferred over their synthetic counterparts on account of their low mammalian toxicity, ecofriendliness and non-hazardous characteristics to non-target subjects. In this article, scientific approaches, their advantages, common characteristics, potentiality and eco-friendly nature of bioagrochemicals have been reviewed.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'YC Tripathi and Sushma Singh and G Tripathi and A Kumar', 'journal': 'Dimensions of Environmental Threats', 'pages': '21', 'publisher': 'Daya Books', 'title': 'BIOAGROCHEMICALS TOWARDS GRADUAL ALLEVIATION OF SYNTHETIC CHEMICALS', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13446230601444548534&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:PVqtIyvKoSUC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small">The biomimetic oxidation of curcumin, a main turmeric pigment with hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by different 5,10,15,20-tetraarylporphyrinatoiron(III) chlorides (TAPFe(III)Cl) in dichloromethane has been studied to give a C-C coupled curcumin dimer in 40-70% yield.

Furthermore, when we examine the recommendations of individual newsletters at a higher frequency (daily as opposed to monthly), we find considerable evidence of timing-ability.

Es handelt sich dabei um kleine, sezernierte Glykoproteine die vorwiegend lokal, aber teilweise auch systemisch wirken. An der Zielzelle binden sie an spezifische Rezeptoren und lösen eine intrazelluläre Signalkaskade aus, bei der Proteine an Tyrosin-, Serin-, und/oder Threonin-Resten phosphoryliert oder dephosphoryliert werden. Dadurch ändern diese ihre Affinität zu anderen Proteinen; in den Zellen werden so Prozesse wie Proliferation, Wachstum, Differenzierung, Gentranskription, Proteinbiosynthese oder Apoptose induziert.

A particular CE may be unstable under one price adjustment mechanism but stable under another. The joint dynamics of the chosen price adjustment mechanism and the given economy determines the overall stability of its competitive equilibrium.

Sensitivity analysis of the core reveals that in the large part of the endowment space where the competitive equilibrium is unique, the core either converges to the single CE or it splits into two segments, one of which converges to the CE and the other disappears.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Martin Shubik and Alok Kumar', 'eprint': 'http://depot.som.yale.edu/icf/papers/fileuploads/2579/original/00-53.pdf', 'number': '1290', 'pages': '00-53', 'publisher': 'Cowles Foundation Discussion Paper', 'title': 'A Computational Analysis of the Core of a Trading Economy with Three Competitive Equilibria and a Finite Number of Traders', 'url': 'https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=282768', 'year': 2001}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">A myth is a legend, parable or a fairly tale. Something that has stayed and passed on from one group/generation to another and is believed to be true. I wish to dispel two myths that are commonly quoted at all meetings and all over the country. The first one is that Indians have small coronary arteries. Twenty years ago during training I learnt that the coronary arteries are as small as the dilator which the surgeon used. One well known surgeon kept only i mm and 1.5 mm dilators. So he saw no coronary artery bigger than 1.5 mm dia. During the last 20 years I have time and again shown to my collegues and students that major coronaries and branches can be as big as 2.0 mm or 2.5 mm in dia. here in India. Amazingly the right coronary artery can admit a 3.0 mm or 3.5 mm dilator at or before its bifurcation. Similarly the LAD can easily be 2.5 mm or even 3.0 mm before the diagonal and at least 2.0 mm after that.

The chemical activity of fluoride ion makes it physiologically more active than any other elemental ion.

Fluoride concentration around 0.5 to 1.0 mg/I is beneficial. But concentrations exceeding 1.5 mg/l pose severe health problems if consumed for a prolonged period.

This departure manifests itself either in terms of a crossover from Ising to mean-field (or classical) critical beliaviour, when moving away from a given critical point (Tc), or by the persistence of only mean-field region in the surprisingly close vicinity ofTc. The non-Ising features of the osmotic compressibility (% T,) in solutions of electrolytes, tliat exhibit one or many liquid-liquid transitions, will be presented. The underlying cause of the breakdown of the anticipated 3-D Ising behaviour in aqueous electrolyte solutions is traced to the structuring induced by the electrolytes. New evidence, constituting measurements of small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and the excess molar volume, is advanced to support the thesis of the close relationship between the structuring and the deviation from the 3-D Ising critical behaviour in aqueous electrolyte solutions.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'A Kumar and J Jacob and BM Jaffar Ali', 'journal': 'Solid State Physics: Proceedings of the DAE Solid State Physics Symposium', 'pages': '3', 'publisher': 'Universities Press', 'title': 'Deviation from 3-D Ising critical behaviour in aqueous electrolyte solutions', 'url': 'http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=su0feL_MldkC&oi=fnd&pg=PA3&dq=info:45jzlzaYQPUJ:scholar.google.com&ots=MifSx2MJN0&sig=Qo50eP_yvBpqztbTVTwevdfctCU', 'volume': '41', 'year': 1999}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:2POsdo3tyOAC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Several laboratories have reported the results of studies carried out in mice made transgenic for variant human transthyretin genes (1).

The use of the promiscuous metallothionein promoter to drive the transgene constructs has resulted in more widespread amyloid deposition than seen in the experiments using the homologous TTR promoter. The use of the human TTR promoter has produced animals expressing the human gene in those tissues normally responsible for TTR synthesis but more circumscribed deposition (3).

The fluorescence intensity of all the Sm 3+ lines is seen to be considerably decreased on account of γ-ray irradiation</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Kumar Akshaya and SB Rai and DK Rai', 'title': 'Effect of γ-ray irradiation on Sm3+ doped oxyfluoroborate glass', 'url': 'https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:33004069', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:vofGIMt6cyEC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small">The aim of the present study was to examine the cellular basis of the involvement of oestradiol and progesterone in blastocyst implantation in the primate.

They are then used to determine the stability domains of solitons in the model with saturating nonlinearity. For the last couple of decades optical solitons in fibers have attracted much attention due to their practical utility in various nonlinear guided wave devices [1-3].

Peptide 1 adopts well-defined -hairpin conformations in CDCl3, C6D6 and (CD3)2SO, nucleated by a D-Pro-Gly Type II -turn, as demonstrated by the observation of characteristic nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) between backbone protons and solvent shielding of NH groups involved in cross-strand hydrogen bonding. Chemical shifts and coupling constants provide further support for the -hairpin conformation, which is consistent with the observation of a single negative circular dichroism band at 216 nm in methanol. In peptide 2, there is no characteristic interstrand NOE observed in (CD3)2SO, while in CDCl3 pronounced aggregation results in line broadening. The observation of a low temperature coefficient for the Leu(6)NH proton favours a population of Pro-Gly Type II -turn conformations. These results suggest that in short peptide sequences, the precise nature of the -turn is critical for hairpin formation, with Type II -turns being particularly effective.</div></div>', 'author': 'Raghothama Srinivasa Rao and Awasthi Satish Kumar and Padmanabhan Balaram', 'title': '-Hairpin nucleation by Pro-Gly-turns.

A dual economic growth model was developed to investigate the relationship between the two sectors and factors affecting Indian economic growth. The study reveals that the GDP growth rate has increased considerably over the period 1950-95 and the increase is more pronounced in the post-economic reforms period. The industrial sector of the economy in the post-economic reforms period. The Indian economy has made a transition from the predominantly agrarian economy to a more balanced economy with the share of agriculture being about 29 per cent and that of industrial sector about 30 per cent during 1992-95. But the share of agricultural sector is still higher than for most of the developing nations. The results of economic growth model indicate that land is an important input to the growth of agriculture in India. The traditional input, such as labour, does not play an important role in the economic development of both the sectors. Capital investment contributed significantly to the growth of industrial sector, but not to the agricultural sector. It was found that the agricultural growth in India is contributed by its industrial sector and the growth of industrial sector depends on its agricultural growth, indicating strong linkages between the agricultural and industrial sectors in Indian economic development.</div></div>', 'author': 'Vijay Paul Sharma and Arvind Kumar', 'eprint': 'http://vslir.iima.ac.in:8080/jspui/bitstream/11718/560/1/WP%201998_1431.pdf', 'title': 'Analysis of agriculture industry linkages in Indian economic development', 'url': 'http://vslir.iima.ac.in:8080/jspui/handle/11718/560', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:sJPMR1oEGYQC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'author': 'VIVEK KUMAR JAIN and A Kumar and DS Seth', 'journal': 'Journal of the Institution of Chemists', 'number': '2', 'pages': '55-58', 'publisher': 'Institution of Chemists', 'title': 'Study of Mixed Ligand complexes of Mn (II) with Reactive Methylene Compounds of Malonamic Acid Series and Formic acid by Polarography', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12053908350497687748&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'volume': '70', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:TaaCk18tZOkC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'author': 'A Kumar and A Saini and SK Jindal and ML Punj', 'journal': 'INDIAN DAIRYMAN', 'pages': '5-10', 'publisher': 'INDIAN DAIRY SCIENCE ASSOCIATION, SECY', 'title': 'Cryopreservation of Embryos of Various Domestic Animals', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2475218165406261857&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'volume': '50', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:tkaPQYYpVKoC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'author': 'A Saka and A Kumar', 'journal': 'INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY HOSPITALITY MANAGEMENT', 'pages': '167-172', 'publisher': 'MCB UNIVERSITY PRESS', 'title': 'Guido Hotel: state ownership or intervention?', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14099802685481159551&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'volume': '10', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:bnK-pcrLprsC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"> <div class="gsh_csp">This paper examines the effect of substitution of water by heavy water in a polymer solution of polystyrene (molecular weight=13000) and acetone.

The shape of the critical line for [polystyrene+acetone+heavy water] is highly asymmetric. An explanation for the occurrence of the water-induced CDP in [polystyrene+acetone] is advanced in terms of the interplay between contact energy dissimilarity and free-volume disparity of the polymer and the solvent. The question of the possible existence of a one-phase<i>hole</i> in an hourglass phase diagram is addressed in [polystyrene+acetone+water].

The company has opted for new coke making facilities in order to be self sufficient in meeting its coke demand for blast furnaces. This has provided for an increased and steady production of coal tar as a by-product. Since the sale opportunities for coal tar are limited at present, and with encouraging results being obtained from the recently adopted pulverized coal injection in the D, F, and G blast furnaces, it was decided to adopt coal tar injection for A and B blast furnaces too. If the results are found economically beneficial, then coal tar injection systems shall be installed in C and E blast furnaces. The present paper discusses the injection system, its simplicity and how it has been designed in-house for utilizing unclean by-product coal tar.

Practically in tfus regard the level of medium (of density equal to that of body) above the surface of body is mainly relevent.

Further increase of applied voltage produces self-starting discharge in the tube causing stoppage of laser output and damage to the Cu-coated epoxy sheet condenser. When air from the atmosphere is used in the discharge tube, the laser power becomes sensitive to the moisture content of air and as a result, it decreases with the increase of humidity The laser power increases approximately by 30% when instead of air commercial grade Ni-gas is used. The approximated N2-laser power at 7.27 KV AC and 77.2 torr tube pressure with the repetition iale fixed at about three pulses per second was measured to be 6 15 x ICT6 watt when spark switching

It uses machine tool settings to solve for an N x M mesh of points on the four surfaces, pinion concave and convex, and gear concave and convex. Points.f creates the file POINTS.OUT, an ASCI file containing N x M points for each surface. (N is the number of node points along the length of the tooth, and M is nodes along the height.)

A three dimensional model with four gear teeth and three pinion teeth is used to determine the contact stresses at two different contact positions in a spiral bevel gearset.

In some diseases, such as lupus glomerulonephritis (GN), cryoglobulinaemia and amyloidosis, the accumulations represent deposits of proteins from the circulation. However, not all fibrils in glomeruli are deposits. In the case of fibrillary GN in patients who lack evidence of systemic disease, the origin and nature of the fibrils is less certain and possibly represent a different pathogenetic mechanism which is discussed below.</div><div class="gsh_csp">Fibrillary GN, as first defined by Rosenmann and Eliakim in 1977, is a clinico-pathological entity characterized by amyloid-like fibrils in glomeruli." The fibrils in fibrillary GN, although morphologically similar to amyloid, are dissimilar in that they do not bind Congo red stain and the fibril diameter (16–24 nm) is wider than amyloid (8–12 nm). Fibrillary GN also differs from amyloid in other ways: unlike amyloid, there is no documented evidence of systemic involvement, and there is no evidence of a plasma cell dyscrasia, gammopathy or serum precursor. A number of different terms have been used to refer to glomerular diseases with fibrillar-tubular accumulations in patients who lack evidence of systemic lupus, amyloidosis, cryoglobulinaemia or paraproteinaemia. This has given rise to some confusion and debate regarding the criteria for inclusion in the category of fibrillary GN as reflected in the various terminology used by different authors," which include: amyloid-like glomerulopathy (Rosenmann, 1977), immunotactoid glomerulopathy (Schwartz, 1980), fibrillary nephritis …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'GLORIA R GALLO and ASHOK KUMAR', 'journal': 'Asian Nephrology: Proceedings of the Fifth Asian Pacific Congress of Nephrology, New Delhi, India, 9-13 December 1992', 'pages': '102', 'publisher': 'Oxford University Press, USA', 'title': 'Fibrillory Glomerulonephritis: The Origin and Noture of the Fibrils', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2052914433422519930&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:JH5k92_tO-AC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small">An extensive simulator has been developed to simulate the dynamics of an intelligent system.

In early stage infected wounds were weak but by 90 days no significant inflammatory reaction was discemible in dexon-sutured wounds but catgut revealed the presence of macrophages and lymphocytes.  There was delayed healing in infected treated wounds without any complication.  Such wounds sutured with dexon revealed low degree of degenerative changes and early healing with sufficient fibroplasia.</div> </div></div>', 'author': 'AK Sharma and A Kumar and H SINGH and SN SHARMA', 'journal': 'Indian Journal of Animal Sciences', 'number': '11', 'pages': '1163-1166', 'publisher': 'INDIAN COUNC AGRICULTURAL RES', 'title': 'EFFECT OF ABSORBABLE SUTURES IN HEALING OF CLEAN AND INFECTED WOUNDS IN BUFFALOS', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11863118934787382580&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'volume': '61', 'year': 1991}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:czbaHzMgHzMC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Carboxylates of the type (I) react with tosyl chloride to yield mixed anhydrides like (III) which, without isolation, are added to nucleophiles.

Monitoring the wheel wear and determining the wheel life assume considerable significance in the automation of the grinding process. Hence suitable methodologies to determine the instant of redressing the grinding wheel, based on the process information, are called for. This paper presents one such method wherein the redress life of the grinding wheel is modelled in terms of the process parameters. The model is based on the Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) technique. The data required to build up the model are generated by suitable experimentation. The tangential force criterion is employed to determine the wheel life. The configuration that may be employed for automatic control of the wheel dressing, based on this wheel life model, is suggested.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'ACS Kumar and URK Rao', 'pages': '336-341', 'publisher': 'Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg', 'title': 'A Methodology for Automating the Redressing of the Grinding Wheel', 'url': 'https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-58214-1_50', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:lL5f5cZgq8MC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">miJi&amp;rie: The purpose of this study was lo analyse the course over tirna of hunmral lmmunofogical response in ABPA.

The conflicting objectives of the project presented difficulties in assessing the feasibility of the proposed water right purchase and formulating an acceptable operating policy.

The cloned genes are widely used as «probes» usually after radioactive labelling. However, inherent drawbacks in handling radio-activity limit their use. As a result, non-radioactive labelling is becoming an attractive alternative. Of late, oligonucleotides are gaining attention as hybridization probes. They can detect single base pair mismatch (for review, see Itakura et al 1984). Synthetic oligonucleotide probes are anticipated to be increasingly used in future with the easy accessibility to the automated DNA synthetizers. We synthetized two oligonucleotide probes, one corresponding to 5’end of gene 6 of bovine rotavirus (strain RF) cloned as pBRF6 (Cohen et al 1984) and another to heat-stable toxin (ST1a) gene (So and Mc Carthy 1980). Using Terminal deoxynucleotidyl Transferase (TdT), the oligonucleotides were labelled with three ribonucleotide phosphate analogs having a free primary amine viz8 (6-aminohexyll-amino ATP (in short: ATP-C8-NH2), N6 [(6-aminohexyl)-carbomoylmethyl-ATP (in short: ATP-N6-NH2) and allylamine UTP. Bio-11-dUTP (BRL) was used as reference. After determining their optimal conditions of tailing, they were tagged with either biotin or fluoresceine. The probes were detected either with strepavidin-alkaline phosphatase complex or with anti-fluoresceine antiserum and alkaline phosphatase conjugated second antibodies. We employed these probes to detect rotaviral RNA and E coli ST1 a toxin DNA.

The wheel life models so developed are analysed to determine the relative influence of the input variables on the redress life. Further, these models are employed to assess the relative performance of the grinding fluids.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Chandra Sekhar Kumar Aduru', 'eprint': 'http://www.eprint.iitd.ac.in/bitstream/2074/4939/1/TH-1581.pdf', 'title': 'Studies on the redress life of the grinding wheel and optimization of the west surface grinding process', 'url': 'http://www.eprint.iitd.ac.in/bitstream/2074/4939/1/TH-1581.pdf', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:ohFW0PAxsewC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"> <div class="gsh_csp">Pulse propagation in optical fibres, including the effects of nonlinear change in the refractive index, group velocity dispersion and losses, is reviewed.

Corolla diameter and corolla tube height showed an increase, relative to diploids. Calyx was narrow and long with pointed ends. Capsules, obtained after crossing with diploids were also narrow and long. To a large extent, it resembled the\'slender\'primary simple trisomic, Triplo—3 described earlier (Reddi &amp; Padmaja 1982). Cytology: Because of the difficulty in analysing pachytene chromosomes in Petunia, pentavalent configuration, characteristic of tertiary trisomies could not be obtained at this stage. However, in 6 PMCs, the extra chromosome was detected in the form of a fold back, having a subterminal centromere and a lightly stained long arm. In another cell, pairing between the long arm of extra chromosome and long arm of chromosome—3, characterised by lightly stained terminal part (Padmaja &amp; Reddi 1981) was observed.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'RL Narasinga Rao and K Arundhati and SS Bir and B Koteswara Rao and VR Reddi and N Saradamani and Aniel Kumar and KG Raja Rao and AR Kulkarni', 'journal': 'The Journal of Cytology and Genetics', 'publisher': 'Society of Cytologists and Geneticists, India', 'title': 'THE JOURNAL OF CYTOLOGY AND GENETICS©', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15330888828514645510&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'volume': '18', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:JZsVLox4iN8C', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'author': 'R Kumar and A Kumar and AK Sharma', 'journal': 'Indian Journal of Animal Sciences', 'title': 'Propanidid and xylazine anaesthesia in dogs.', 'url': 'http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=IN19840045445', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:0qX8s2k1IRwC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">the pH of the test solution was adjusted with HN0B/NH40H solution.

Adults were kept in plastic jars in a BOD incubator set at 30±1 C, with photophase of 17L: 7D and RH of about 70 per cent. They were fed on fresh potato leaves. Females laid eggs on the surfaces of leaves in clusters. Eggs were collected and allowed to hatch.

Average couples had 2.6 living children; most lived in nuclear family arrangements.  Almost 18% had migrated to Lucknow within 5 years.  In spite of increased services available more than 33% of the women did not use either antenatal or delivery services the main reasons being ignorance lack of cooperation among family members and apprehension of rude behavior by hospital staff.  The latter reason was also given for nonuse of child health services together with faith in private treatment; nearly 31% did not get their children immunized against any disease and of those who initiated immunization only 13% completed it.  Recommendations include greater emphasis on bringing unserved clients into available services bringing education and information to bear on the reasons for nonuse stressing the importance of doctor/patient and nurse/patient relationships and raising the "immunization consciousness" and following up on immunization cases.</div></div>', 'author': 'A Kumar', 'journal': 'Popcen Newsletter', 'number': '2', 'pages': '1-5', 'title': 'Utilisation pattern of MCH services in an urban community.', 'url': 'https://www.popline.org/node/391959', 'volume': '8', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:x-IcQEm-ju4C', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'author': 'A KUMAR and K CHANDRA and M SINGH', 'journal': 'JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY', 'number': '7', 'pages': '843-845', 'publisher': 'INDIAN CHEMICAL SOC', 'title': 'STUDIES ON THE SUPPRESSION OF POLAROGRAPHIC MAXIMUM OF MN (II) BY SOME UNI-VALENT AND POLY-VALENT CATIONS VIS-A-VIS THEIR INFLUENCE ON THE KINETICS OF THE ELECTRODE-REACTION OF …', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=333987161746403092&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'volume': '59', 'year': 1982}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:ib87rSy7x5MC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">[en] A method is described for the direct determination of cadmium by flameless atomic absorption spectrophotometry.

The virus is    responsible for causing disease both in humans as well as horses. Mosquito species    (<i>Aedes camptorhynchus</i> and <i> Aedes vigilax</i>; <i>Culex annulirostris</i>)    are the most important vector for this virus.

This requires a proper treatment of the waiting-time distribution for the first observed hop of a carrier on the lattice. The waiting-time distributions for both the first observed hop and for time intervals between consecutive hops are defined in terms of configuration averages of the random walk on the random medium. The treatment includes explicitly the effect of an important disorder-induced space-time correlation, which is found to be entirely responsible for the frequency dependence of the conductivity, sigma (omega).

Two statistical models, one based on normally distributed joint servo errors, and the other based on uniformly distributed joint servo errors, are presented to estimate the positioning error of the hand. The surfaces within which the manipulator hand achieves a specified level of positioning accuracy with a given probability are plotted. Another method, which is more attractive computationally to plot the surfaces of positioning accuracy is also developed. An algorithm is presented to plot the surfaces which bound the different workspaces associated with a manipulator. A scheme is developed to label these surfaces and to identify the surface which bounds the reachable workspace.

They conceive of a complicated process of the interaction, between society and politics as the determining factor in the evolution of the leadership among the tribal people of Bihar. It is proposed to use" comparative method" in this paper, and to analyse the concept of leadership in the light of the changing political-behaviourial pattern of the tribal social organization. The basis of the comparative method is to approach the problem from the point of veiw of two or more different disciplines (inter-disciplinary approach). The intention is to bring together the essence of History, Political Science, Geography and Sociology in an attempt to provide a critical analysis of the problem of tribal leadership. Geographical forces have profound influeence over the quality of the leader. The movement factor8 is important so far as it creates fluidity and mobility in the personality, as" ell as the character of the leader. It opens for him the door to dynamic ideas. In closed communities where the topography is\' harsh and the modern means of communication have not yet reached, the leader adjusts to the environment and maintains some kind of an ecological balance. A person in order to become a leader must be acquainted with the iconography of the region he represents. If the region has rich and resourceful iconographic landscape, the leader maintains a cherished heritage. The\'movement-factor\'creates instability exposing the people to newer ideas.

Major advantage of this method is that it gives relevant spectra without getting into the complexities of a standard shell model calculation.

This merged shock layer is investigated in this paper for a radiating gas. The radiating transfer is simplified to the emission-dominated case. The basic model of the flow is described by the full Navier-Stokes equations. Using the concept of local similarity, the equations are reduced to an eighth-order set of nonlinear, coupled ordinary differential equations. This set of equations is integrated numerically from the surface to the freestream under different prescribed conditions. Earlier, this problem was investigated by Liu and Sogame [3] within the framework of two thin-layer model. A number of inaccuracies of this analytical development are pointed out.

Fertile female guinea pigs were injected im with .1 ml/animal/month of either a mixture of dihydroxyprogesterone acetophenide and estradiol-17-enanthate (mixed group) or medroxyprogesterone acetate Depo-Provera (DP group).  Animals in the control group received normal saline.  3 weeks after the 3rd injection the animals were killed and the serum liver heart and ovaries analyzed for cholesterol (Chol) total and differential phospholipids (PLP) and triglycerides (TG).  All these tissues were also examined histopathologically.  The results show that in the mixed group there was a significant decrease in Chol PLP and TG in serum; and in the DP group only serum Chol was significantly increased.  Levels of TG in the liver of both the treated groups were elevated.  The TG of heart only in the DP group was elevated.  Since there was no effect on serum free fatty acid levels it appeared that the increase in tissue TG is the result of an influence on synthesis and/or transport.  Histopathological examination showed follicular degeneration with arrest of corpus luteum and ova were absent or necrosed.  There was no histological evidence of fatty infiltration of the tissues examined.

MC-CDMA is being investigated as an alternative technology for fourth generation (4G) and fifth generation (5G) mobile systems because of its ability to resist multipath fading. Social Impact Theory is based on the socio-psychological behavior of humans in the society. In this paper a social impact based multiuser detector has been employed to mitigate the effect of NBI in MC-CDMA systems. The proposed approach opens a new era of social impact based intelligent networks. The proposed method has been compared with other conventional stochastic methods like Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) on different parameters. Numerical results show that the proposed detector works with much lesser number of iterations and reduces the complexity manifold.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Anmol Kumar and Jyoti Saxena', 'eprint': 'https://www.ripublication.com/awmc17/awmcv10n1_11.pdf', 'title': 'A Social Impact Approach for Digital NBI Mitigation in MC-CDMA Systems', 'url': 'https://www.ripublication.com/awmc17/awmcv10n1_11.pdf'}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:z1mV0M3xdQ0C', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Ground movement takes place even if the mine is abandoned not active due to the existence of underground voids or undersized supporting pillars.

This paper describes an application of confocal sensor for devising a non-contact measurement of physical parameters ie bending angle and bending radius measurement. The various other non-contact measurement methods has been discussed. This method is suitable for a 4 or 5-axis CNC machine serving the application of measurement and just requires installation of confocal sensor and simple fixture for holding the plate. Irrespective of the material, measurement can be performed easily. The C# program used for control and automation of the confocal and linear slide have been depicted using a flowchart. The basic methodology and equations adopted for measurement has been presented.

They produce thrust by a complex morpho-functional flapping phenomenon. The comparison of flight features of these three types of fliers gives us some useful clues on the nature of natural wing materials having special properties (like light weight and high flexibility) which have to be considered seriously for their usage in Micro aerial vehicle’s to enhance their aerodynamic efficiency. The evolutionary history of these fliers and flapping is a notable feature.</div><div class="gsh_csp">Insects are miniature fliers having low mass, resilin, and membranous chitinous wings, with high flapping frequency of 500 Hz or more. To imitate them is difficult. Birds and bat wings are modified teteapod limbs for flight. Birds have thousands of keratin feathers which cannot be replicated easily. In birds, the finger bones are reduced. However in bats, the finger bones are highly elongated (delicately) and the whole body is covered by membrane. It may be easier to imitate bat model and not its echo location. Anti stalling devices (Alula in birds) need further study. Their effortless landing and takeoff is notable for micro aerial vehicle design.

The codominant nature of molecular markers reduces significantly the quantity of breeding material and also promotes the selection of superior genotypes. Molecular markers are widely employed in plant breeding and also used for the acceleration of selection of plant with the help marker assisted selection.

The hydraulic retention time (HRT) of the pilot scale UASB reactor was fixed at 8 hours with CFID operation at 20, 8 and 6 hours, respectively under both DO limiting (&lt; 0.5 mg/L) and non limiting (&gt; 2.5 mg/L) concentrations. Best effluent quality from the CFID over the six study phases was obtained with a 6 hour duration cycle, 8 hour HRT, non limiting dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration (2.5-3.5 mg/L) at MLVSS based organic loading (F/M) of 0.10-0.64 aerated day-1. The corresponding mean BOD, TSS, Ammonia Nitrogen and fecal coliform removal efficiencies of the CFID reactor were up to 83, 90, 74 and 99%, respectively.

First examining the definitions and international experiences of crude oil volatility, a qualitative approach is taken to examine the impact of volatility on major indicators. This paper takes a broad definition of volatility looking at demand, supply and speculation In addition, a manifestation of the country’s dependence on oil and its reflection through different economic and physical indicators such as share of oil in the energy basket, importance of crude oil and petroleum products in the trade balance and the patterns of trade in the recent years is also examined to understand the extent of vulnerability to shocks. It has been found that the vulnerability to these is expected to rise in the future as dependence on imported oil is projected to rise. Finally, based on international experience, measures to mitigate this vulnerability have been recommended. The case study is organized according to four subsystems of the socio-economic system, namely: energy; transport; agriculture &amp; macro-economy. Each of the four major sections includes a brief overview of the subsystem, an analysis of its oil dependency, and a discussion of the likely impacts of oil shocks under business-as-usual policy environments.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Ashutosh Kumar and Ashadevi Utthirapathy', 'title': 'Global Oil Markets and India’s Vulnerability to Oil Shocks', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17947101133208904718&hl=en&oi=scholarr'}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:cOP-uZQ6k_YC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Hot deformation behaviour of austenitic steel was investigated by conducting isothermal hot compression tests using Gleeble Thermo-mechanical Simulator in the deformation temperature range of 1073 K–1223 K and strain rate range of 0.1–100 s–1 with 70% maximum reduction. All the flow curves exhibit a good relationship between deformation temperature and strain rate. The wellknown Kocks-Mecking (KM model) work hardening model was used to interpret the hot work hardening behaviour of steel. Two stages of work hardening behaviour was revealed in θ. σ vs. σ at all temperatures and slow strain rates except at a strain rate of 100 s–1 where a five-stage work hardening behaviour was observed. Stage I–an initial transient stage, where θ. σ decreases rapidly with σ, stage II–a stage where θ. σ increases gradually with σ to a maximum value and stage III–a stage where θ. σ decreases due to dynamic recovery. In Stage IV, work hardening rate increases, and again a distinct drop in slope towards negative value shows the characteristic of stage V. Stage I in plot θ. σ vs. σ is totally missing at high temperature for slow strain rate, whereas at high temperature (except 100 s–1) stages II is not prominent.

However this not only results in loss of spatial flexibility, make the consumer equipment immobile due to limited lengths of connecting wires but also the entire wired system becomes very clumsy. For better flexibility and integration of wireless equipment like cell phones, the wired systems have been replaced by wireless communication technologies like Blue Tooth*, Wi-fi*, and Universal Plug and Play*(UPnP). However their utility is limited due to non availability of large band width and their inability to communicate multimedia content with high speed.

Since nodes are highly mobile and network topology changes rapidly it is necessary to enhance delay. The goal of this paper is to reduce delay and collision by using MAC protocol TDMA in routing. Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) is a method to channel access by more than one user in which available frequency is divided into multiple time slots so that nodes can access medium in its slot. In this paper we apply TDMA approach on routing such that all nodes which are active in same time slot will be selected in that particular timestamp to form route so that no node has to wait for activation of another node which would be available in another time slot.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Shivani Pandey and Arvind Kumar', 'eprint': 'http://www.ijcttjournal.org/2017/Volume47/number-2/IJCTT-V47P111.pdf', 'title': 'An Effective TDMA Based Routing for VANET to Reduce Delay', 'url': 'http://www.ijcttjournal.org/2017/Volume47/number-2/IJCTT-V47P111.pdf'}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:nmnCZhbNdt4C', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small">Presents an index of the authors whose articles are published in the conference proceedings record.</div></div>', 'author': 'A Subha Priyadharshini and A Veeralakshmi and A Anita Angeline and A Arulmurugan and A Elamathy and A Kavya and A Mallikarjuna Prasad and A Manikandan and A Martin and A Rajesh and A Abinaya and A Amsaveni and A Diana Andrushia and A Jemima and A Jeyapriya and AK Bhattacharjee and A Kayalvizhi and A Khathija Banu and A Rajeswari and Aasish Kumar and Abha R Gulhane and Abhay Bindal and Abhijeet Kumar and K Abhishek and Abhishek Mishra and Accamma Cherian and KK Accamma and Agila Kanakaraj and Aisha Al-Noori and Aishwarya Alva and K Aishwarya and Ajit Kumar Panda and Aju John KK and Aju John and Akash Singh Chauhan and Akhil Khanna and Akshaya Raj and Alfred Daniel and Alfred Kirubaraj and Amar Nath Dubey', 'eprint': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel7/7112413/7124722/07125065.pdf', 'title': 'Author Name', 'url': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7125065/'}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:C14xlUzwkXEC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Public Distribution System in India has been one of the most crucial elements in food policy and food security system in the country and with special emphasis to the functioning of public sector agricultural warehousing agencies such as Food Corporation of India (FCI) and Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC), engaged in the procurement, transportation, storage and distribution of food grains, It is the largest distribution network of its kind in the world.

We use Drosophila melanogaster as a model system to identify genes that function to regulate these processes. Important cellular regulatory pathways are evolutionarily conserved; thus, molecules identified as regulators of these processes in Drosophila are likely to have homologs in vertebrates and the pathways that link these molecules are likely to be regulated similarly.

A slow-fading channel model is considered and the outage probability is derived as a performance measure. The diversity gain defined as the signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) exponent at high SNR is analyzed. Interestingly in the presence of misalignment fading the diversity gain depends only on the misalignment variance and is independent of the number of transmitters M and receivers N. Increasing the number of transmitters and receivers only results in a lower probability of outage for a given SNR, however, the rate of change is unaffected. Contrary to this case, the diversity gain of MIMO FSO systems in the presence of atmospheric fading and no misalignment is shown to be proportional to the number of transmitters and receivers, in particular the product M N.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'VARNA JYOTHI and A SANTHOSH KUMAR and ASST PROF', 'eprint': 'https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7277/67948e07d4305a9c8c38d6c413e7be1c51db.pdf', 'title': 'ON THE PROBABILITY DENSITY FUNCTION OF SIGNAL INTENSITY IN FREE-SPACE OPTICAL WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS', 'url': 'https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7277/67948e07d4305a9c8c38d6c413e7be1c51db.pdf'}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:W-zclTkWZekC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Crane hooks are highly liable components that are typically used for industrial purposes.

PAPR reduction is implemented in the handheld devices and low complexity is a major objective. High PAPR is one of the major disadvantages of OFDM system which is resulted from large envelope fluctuation of the signal. Our proposed technique to reduce the PAPR is based on constellation shaping that starts with a larger constellation of points, and then the points with higher energy are removed. The constellation shaping algorithm is combined with peak reduction, with extra abilities defined to reduce the signal peak. This method, called MMSE-Threshold, has a significant improvement in PAPR reduction with low computational complexity. The peak reduction formulated into a quadratic minimization problem is subsequently optimized by the semi-definite programming algorithm, and the simulation results show that the PAPR of semi-definite programming algorithm (SDPA) has noticeable improvement over MMSE-Threshold while SDPA has higher complexity. Results are also presented for the PAPR minimization by applying optimization techniques such as hill climbing and simulated annealing. The simulation results indicate that for a small number of sub-carriers, both hill climbing and simulated annealing result in a significant improvement in PAPR reduction, while their degree of complexity can be very large.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Arun Kumar and Sandip Vijay and Ashish Kr Gupta and RK Singh', 'eprint': 'https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e0b3/c068158055ebad5c6aad6853c3e0b25a72c1.pdf', 'title': 'PAPR Reduction in Wireless OFDM Systems', 'url': 'https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e0b3/c068158055ebad5c6aad6853c3e0b25a72c1.pdf'}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:LIyjJRbbAUMC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr">Page 1.

Recent work has shown that these miRNA expression patterns can be used to classify tumor cells, and that this classification can be more accurate than the classification achieved by using messenger RNA gene expression patterns. One aspect of miRNA biogenesis that makes them particularly attractive as a biomarker is the fact that they are maintained in a protected state in serum and plasma, thus allowing the detection of miRNA expression patterns directly from serum. This study is focused on the evaluation of miRNA expression patterns in human serum for five types of human cancer: prostate, colon, ovarian, breast, and lung, using a pan-human-miRNA high-density microarray. This microarray platform enables the simultaneous analysis of all human miRNAs by either fluorescent or electrochemical signals and can be easily redesigned to include newly identified miRNAs. We show that sufficient miRNAs are present in one milliliter of serum to detect miRNA expression patterns without the need for amplification techniques. In addition, we are able to use these expression patterns to discriminate correctly between normal and cancer patient samples.</div><div class="gsh_csp">Conclusion:</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Dominic Suciu and Michael Lodes and Marcelo Caraballo and Sandra Munro and Amit Kumar and Brooke P Anderson', 'eprint': 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.326.4196&rep=rep1&type=pdf', 'title': 'Detection of Cancer with Serum miRNAs on an Oligonucleotide Microarray', 'url': 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.326.4196&rep=rep1&type=pdf'}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:3GgZsIzdB2YC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': 'introduction: Hypertension is one of the commonest chronic disease in our country.

The superior water quality and small footprint make this technology a promising alternative for future water treatment system. However, retention of impurities (organic and inorganic) eg natural organic matter, metal salts during filtration results in membrane fouling and eventually reduces the life of the membrane. Although, two methods:(1) pretreatment of raw water and (2) Backwashing and chemical cleaning are generally used to control fouling. However, it can lead to increase in overall filtration time/treatment steps, addition of extra chemicals, and concentrated brine. The objective of this study was to address this issue and to study feasibility of improving removal effectiveness of membrane filtration process by incorporating nanomaterials in membranes. This study identified three different factors describing effects of nanomaterials on membrane filtration:(1) Antifouling properties,(2) Membrane flux, and (3) Surface characteristics. For example, addition of nanoboehmite and TiO2 addition in PES membrane improve its hydrophilicity, reducing it fouling tendencies. Lastly, current knowledge gaps in these factors were identified which need to be researched further for improving potential of incorporation of nanomaterials in membranes. These efforts are expected to result in use of membrane filtration processes for providing safe drinking water.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'N Mehta and S Basu and A Kumar', 'eprint': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Naorem_Singh2/publication/317184613_Character_association_and_path_analysis_for_yield_and_its_components_in_Indian_mustard_Brassica_juncea_L_Czern_and_Coss/links/592be29daca27295a80c2874/Character-association-and-path-analysis-for-yield-and-its-components-in-Indian-mustard-Brassica-juncea-L-Czern-and-Coss.pdf#page=62', 'journal': 'Environmental Sustainability: Concepts, Principles, Evidences and Innovations', 'pages': '52', 'title': 'Incorporating Benefits of Nanomaterials in Membrane Filtration Process for Producing Safe Drinking Water', 'url': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Naorem_Singh2/publication/317184613_Character_association_and_path_analysis_for_yield_and_its_components_in_Indian_mustard_Brassica_juncea_L_Czern_and_Coss/links/592be29daca27295a80c2874/Character-association-and-path-analysis-for-yield-and-its-components-in-Indian-mustard-Brassica-juncea-L-Czern-and-Coss.pdf#page=62'}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:r8lgQMkXaCEC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">II.

Material and methods: 200 patients in 2 groups, 100 in each group with clinically diagnosed oral premalignant and malignant lesions respectively were selected. An oral brush cytology (LBC technique) followed by incisional biopsy were performed for every patient. Considering the histopathological diagnosis as the gold standard, the cytopathological scores were compared using statistical analysis of the samples. Results: In premalignant cases, 86% cases were male and 14% were female, while in malignant lesions, 91% patients were males, and 9% were females. Older age group especially of 31-50 years was predominantly affected (68% of premalignant cases, 56% of malignant cases). Oral submucous fibrosis fallowed by leukoplakia were found to be most common premalignant lesions. Buccal mucosa for premalignant and tongue for malignant lesions were found to be the most common site involved. Either tobacco chewing or smoking or both were found to be most common predisposing habits for both premalignant and malignant lesions.

Ethnopharmacology has significant role in drug development with primary focus on empirical facets of indigenous plant use thus identifying remarkably potent pharmacologically active compounds. There is enough evidence supporting this fact. Moreover the initiative includes thorough data on native resources of flora. On the contrary primary objective of bioprospecting sets off towards drug discovery at a global level. There are numerous accounts where this approach aims specifically towards antifungals. The underlying difference being natural compounds in its pure form are exploited as drugs. This being complementary in the former approach where rather than pure form extracts are employed.

It plays an important role in the long-term development of a country not only as a source of capital but also for enhancing competitiveness of the domestic economy through transfer of technology, strengthening infrastructure, raising productivity and generating new employment opportunities</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Anil Kumari and Surender Kumar Gupta', 'title': 'IMPACT OF FDI ON INDIAN BANKING SECTOR', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8378077287043567672&hl=en&oi=scholarr'}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:pNwUjlbgJN8C', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Molecular nitrogen is one of the important constituent of the atmosphere. When an energetic electron is absorbed in a gas, it is well known that it loses most of its energy in ionizing collisions. Due to ionizations secondaries are produced which further take part in exciting and ionizing the gas constituents. The ﬂuorescence produced in visible region is principally due to NJ; ﬁrst negative, N2 ﬁrst and second positive and N; Meinel Bands. The efﬁciency, with which the kinetic energy of the incident electron has been transferred to particular emission, is regarded as an important parameter and is investigated by various workers (Davidson &amp; O’Neil 1964; Khare 1969; and Khare &amp; Kumar 1973). Theoretical calculations Khare (1969) have been carried out only for 3914 A (0, 0) band of ﬁrst negative group of N15.

Indian coal has high ash content (35-45%) and low calorific value (3500-4000 Kcal/kg). Consequently, presently about 60 million tonnes (mt) per year of coal ash is being produced in India. Assuming that out of 140,000 MW of additional power capacity to be set by the year 2007, 70% shall be coal based in line with current trend, it has been estimated that total ash production shall reach a staggering figure of almost 175 million tonnes/year.

Modern weather radars ie Doppler radars are capable of detecting the motion of rain droplets in addition to the intensity of the precipitation to determine the structure of storms and their potential to cause severe weather. Hence, it is a key forecasting tool. Weather radars send directional pulses of microwave radiation, on the order of a microsecond long, using a cavity magnetron or klystron tube connected by a waveguide to a parabolic antenna and receives the return signals from particles in the air on the order of a millisecond, which is a thousand times longer than the pulse duration.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Abhishek Kumar and Dharmveer Singh', 'eprint': 'https://media.neliti.com/media/publications/239310-a-review-on-weather-surveillance-radar-da20ca25.pdf', 'journal': 'International Journal of Advanced Engineering, Management and Science', 'number': '1', 'publisher': 'Infogain Publication', 'title': 'A Review on “Weather Surveillance Radar”', 'url': 'https://www.neliti.com/publications/239310/a-review-on-weather-surveillance-radar', 'volume': '1'}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:SpbQ_efOBbkC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">The objective of this study was to investigate the antiulcer activity of leaves of Andrographis echioides N.(Acanthaceae) in rats.

The power series method is a well known procedure to solve ODEs with variable coefficients. The resulting series can be used to analyze and visualize the nature of the solutions of ODE’s for which direct calculation is difficult. Manually solving a series solution using power series method is tedious and time consuming. In this paper a special package using SAGE (an open source software) have been developed, which can calculate any number of coefficients with no restriction to obtain the series solutions of up to third order ODE at an ordinary point.

Migration of male labour force from Bihar has increased during last two decades. It was observed that the youngsters are more prone to migration and most of them are migrating to urban centers for non-farm work. Migration helped more rational use of two critical inputs, labour and irrigation in rice production on migrant households. The migration seems to have helped in judicious use of human labour at native place due to migration of surplus labour force for gainful employment to destination of migration.

In view of the biological importance of polyhydroquinolines, several methods for their synthesis have been reported. More recently catalysts such as molecular iodine, TMSCl, HClO4–SiO2, Yb (OTf) 3, CAN, Sc (OTf) 3, silica sulphuric acid and ionic liquid have been employed for their synthesis [3]. However, many of these methods have some disadvantages such as use of halogenated reagents, catalyst loadings of up to 30 mol%, longer reaction times and drastic reaction conditions. Therefore, it was thought to develop a new and convenient method for the synthesis of polyhydroquinolines.

The aims of the ‘education of the emotions’ are to provide a suitable environment for the unfolding of the affective aspects of the person. It is studied that children who gained more insight into their emotional lives, were better able to cope with distress and anxiety, to the extent that they gained insight into the causes of those emotions. The most disturbing data comes from the massive survey of parents and teachers and shows a world wide trend for the present generation of children to be more troubled emotionally than the last: more lonely and depresses more angry and unruly, more nervous and prone to worry, more impulsive and aggressive. Emotional development is taken as for granted. For the most part, people regard it as something that just happens… Thus, retard emotional development, emotional immaturity, poor emotional control, and so forth are used to explain a person’s inappropriate social behaviour and many other kinds of pathological behaviour.

The evolutionary computation attempts to mimic the biological evolution. In biological systems, at the cellular level, a gene is the basic unit of heredity. An organism’s genes are carried on one of a pair of chromosomes in the form of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The DNA is in the form of a double helix and carries a symbolic system of base-pair sequences that determine the sequence of enzymes and other proteins in an organism.

The model combines the chemical equilibrium and the thermodynamic equilibrium of the global reaction, predicting the final composition of the producer gas as well as the gasification temperature. Once the composition of the producer gas is obtained, a range of parameters can be derived, from which the maximum heating value of the producer gas can be known. This work includes a parametric study of the influence of the gasifying amount of oxygen and the moisture content of the biomass on the characteristics of the process and the producer gas composition.

In this paper, we propose a reliable scheme for secured online interoperable fund transfer among banking institutions. In our approach, we facilitate minimal sharing of individual user’s private data among banking institutions and eliminate the urge of complete overhaul of any existing framework for its implementation. The proposed scheme is based on loosely coupled service orientation using SOAP and web services with exchange of documents of open standards like XML. The approach has inherent capability of providing authenticity and higher security with protection of confidentiality of information involved in the transfer at an affordable computational time.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Aakash Roy and Ajeet Kumar and Debasish Jana and Debasis Mitra and Radha Tamal Goswami', 'eprint': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Debasish_Jana/publication/266485876_Online_Scheme_Towards_Secured_Inter_Banking_Fund_Transfer/links/54c891c00cf289f0ced077a8.pdf', 'title': 'Online Scheme Towards Secured Inter Banking Fund Transfer', 'url': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Debasish_Jana/publication/266485876_Online_Scheme_Towards_Secured_Inter_Banking_Fund_Transfer/links/54c891c00cf289f0ced077a8.pdf'}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:twffdjNOitAC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Cloud computing has become a buzzword in the IT industry.

We present a novel discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-based channel estimator for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. The conventional DFT-based estimator zeroes out noise-dominant values in the transform domain, which suffers from a poor performance in the presence of channel leakage. Some improved estimators have been proposed, but these estimators all focus on reducing the leaked energy. We propose to estimate the channel leakage by using the partial minimum mean square error (MMSE) filtering. When the channel delay is sufficiently less than the duration of an OFDM symbol, the partial MMSE filtering can be simplified. We propose several improved adaptive sparse channel estimation methods using Lp-norm normalized LMS (LP-NLMS) and Lp-norm normalized LMS (L0-NLMS). Simulation results show that the proposed channel estimator achieves much better performance than conventional estimators and well approaches the MMSE estimator. Comparing with previous methods, effectiveness of the proposed methods is confirmed by computer simulations.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'S Aruna Kumari and A Ashok Kumar', 'eprint': 'https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2ed3/d8ac9d1cff7a9d8ef8f5fdca52338a010c09.pdf', 'title': 'Leakage Estimation in DFT-based Channel Estimator for OFDM by using Minimum Mean Square Estimator', 'url': 'https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2ed3/d8ac9d1cff7a9d8ef8f5fdca52338a010c09.pdf'}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:z2g7kDSNNyoC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'author': 'I HorvaĀth and P Panayotatos and Y Lu and SK Bhattacharya and RR Tummala and AGM Strollo and E Napoli and D De Caro and MWT Wong and AMF Yu and CK Li and R Duffy and A Concannon and A Mathewson and B Lane and A Kumar and E Kalra and S Haldar and RS Gupta and A Fissore and MAR Alves and E da Silva Braga and L Cescato and Z Tang and FG Shi and G Golan and A Axelevitch and R Margolin and E Rabinovitch and PK Chan and LS Ng and L Siek and KT Lau and G Kamoulakos and Th Haniotakis and Y Tsiatouhas and JP Schoellkopf and A Arapoyanni and JC Lusth and CB Hanna and JC DõĀaz-VeĀlez and KW Liu and AFM Anwar', 'title': 'LIST OF CONTENTS', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7804361311751161401&hl=en&oi=scholarr'}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:gubd_9ZgCi8C', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Energy demand is growing rapidly day by day and to meet this ever increasing energy demand, the dependence on the conventional energy sources is increasing which is resulting in the pollution, green house effect and global warming.

Data storage became easier as the availability of large amounts of computing power at low cost ie the cost of processing power and storage is falling, made data cheap. There was also the introduction of new machine learning methods for knowledge representation based on logic programming etc. in addition to traditional statistical analysis of data. The new methods tend to be computationally intensive hence a demand for more processing power. Having concentrated so much attention on the accumulation of data the problem was what to do with this valuable resource?

They were originally developed from the inspiration of human brains. In human brains, a biological neuron collects signals from other neurons through a host of fine structures called dendrites. The neuron sends out spikes of electrical activity through a long, thin stand known as an axon, which splits into thousands of branches. At the end of each branch, a structure called a synapse converts the activity from the axon into electrical effects that inhibit or excite activity in the connected neurons. When a neuron receives excitatory input that is sufficiently large compared with its inhibitory input, it sends a spike of electrical activity down its axon. Learning occurs by changing the effectiveness of the synapses so that the influence of one neuron on another changes. Like human brains, neural networks also consist of processing units (artificial neurons) and connections (weights) between them. The processing units transport incoming information on their outgoing connections to other units. The" electrical" information is simulated with specific values stored in those weights that make these networks have the capacity to learn, memorize, and create relationships amongst data. A very important feature of these networks is their adaptive nature where" learning by example" replaces" programming" in solving problems. This feature makes such computational models very appealing in application domains where …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Amrender Kumar', 'eprint': 'http://cabgrid.res.in/cabin/publication/smfa/Module%20IV/4.Practical%20on%20Artificial%20Neural%20Networks%20%20_Amrender%20Kumar.pdf', 'title': 'PRACTICAL ON ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS', 'url': 'http://cabgrid.res.in/cabin/publication/smfa/Module%20IV/4.Practical%20on%20Artificial%20Neural%20Networks%20%20_Amrender%20Kumar.pdf'}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:zEYdoEEwLqEC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Reversible logic is highly useful in nanotechnology, low power design and quantum computing.

The cellular response of human sperm cells to different cooling rates, varying between 5 C/min and 300 C/min, is studied using the diffusion limited transport model. The membrane permeability parameters are taken from the published literature. For a cooling rate lower than the optimal value, almost all intracellular water flows out to the extracellular compartment through the cell membrane leaving behind only the osmotically inactive cell volume inside the cell. For the calculation of the amount of intracellular ice formation, it has been assumed that the amount of water trapped inside the human sperm at-19 C will finally form intracellular ice with sufficient super-cooling.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'D Devismita and A Kumar and R KrishnaKumar', 'eprint': 'http://www.academia.edu/download/25705529/researchpaper_5ccryopreservation-of-human-sperm-effect-of-cooling-rate-on-intracellular-ice-formation.pdf', 'title': 'Cryopreservation of Human Sperm: Effect of Cooling Rate on Intracellular Ice Formation', 'url': 'http://www.academia.edu/download/25705529/researchpaper_5ccryopreservation-of-human-sperm-effect-of-cooling-rate-on-intracellular-ice-formation.pdf'}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:kFM4V80Y5EsC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Background: Leprosy services have been integrated into the general health care system to reduce the differences between people affected by leprosy and those suffering from other health conditions.

These tools, called ‘Instrumented pipeline inspection gauge’(IPIG) have the ability to detect, characterize and geographically localize metal loss (corrosion or gauging) defects on or within the buried pipelines as-well-as major pipe features (welds, flange, support, valve etc). Pipeline operators are required to periodically get their pipelines inspected by IPIGs, thereby ensuring its heath through corrective measures in case possibilities of pipe leak arise. To keep pace with the ever advancing ILI technology available globally to cater for the stringent inspection specifications laid down by apex agencies like Pipeline Operator Forum (POF), there is an urgent need for undertaking new indigenous technology developments in the areas of sensing and inspection capability of ILI tools. Existing technology developed and delivered by BARC has limited ability to distinguish a metal loss defect on the exterior pipe-wall to that on the interior, particularly if it the defect is shallow and small in surface extent. This distinction is of paramount importance as regard to the preventive measures to be taken up by the pipeline operators to circumvent corrosion growth within or on the pipe surface. With this in mind, secondary sensors based on eddy current technology is developed by BARC to replace the earlier, less efficient sensors based on remnant magnetism.

Language based specification approach is one of the finest technique to parse syntactic or semantic specification of a given token, which is treated as input in this proposed work. It suggests a standard notation to define the specifications of the inputs named as context-free grammar. This grammatical model describes the token as a legal text to which a mapping is applicable along with keys. For the mapping with keys, a standard quadruple value with possible set of values are derived for each node starting from initial client to different users. The model describes a standard notation of which every client must satisfy the approach proposed. Based on the notation authentication is achieved to all possible metrics with the help of language specification approach. The proposal includes context free grammatical approach as an introductory phase, next about the terminology section that followed by the sample algorithm and finally the merits that supports the work.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'A SENTHIL KUMAR and K RAVIKUMAR', 'eprint': 'http://ijarcsa.org/nov_2014/IJARCSA/1211140c03.pdf', 'title': 'LANGUAGE SPECIFICATION MODEL AND KEY-QUADRUPLE ASSIGNMENT APPROACH FOR SECURE BASED INFORMATION', 'url': 'http://ijarcsa.org/nov_2014/IJARCSA/1211140c03.pdf'}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:pk6FPx6l9xIC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">This paper presents use of soft computing techniques to study the load frequency control of interconnected power system.

Huber (1991) writes that organizational change means a new position or another position compared to how the organization functioned and how its members and leaders acted earlier. Change is a type of organizational development while the members of the organization change by the input of new strategies, which in turn leads to behavioral change. The change will develop the organization to better fit predicted future environments.(Porras &amp; Silvers, 1991) According to Nonas (2005), Porras and Silvers (1991) theory indicates that the organization has complete control over its development. Organizations are open systems meaning that they are characterized by continuously ongoing processes of input, transformation and output interacting with a surrounding environment. It is impossible to achieve complete control over an open system, while it is affected by external forces consisting of surrounding systems, like customer, supplier, society etc.(Katz &amp; Kahn, 1987). Change is constant modification that comes about of unexpected events in everyday work. This theory assumes that it is impossible to have complete control over the organization’s development and that the result of a change will normally not be exactly as the predicted result.(Norrgren et al., 1996 in Nonas, 2005) In Nonas (2005, pp 6) the following popular definition of change can be read:“the only thing that can be predicted about a change is that no change follows its original plan”. One main factor in implementing a successful organizational change is that much attention is focused on communication. It is a tool for …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Anil Kumar and Karol Bagh New Deelhi', 'eprint': 'http://www.academia.edu/download/34303397/NzJGV6yyJy77wyG.pdf', 'title': 'IMPACT OF CHANGE AGENT IN CHANGE PROCESS', 'url': 'http://www.academia.edu/download/34303397/NzJGV6yyJy77wyG.pdf'}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:SoGhKUJvMTQC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">The crystallization of hydrogenated amorphous silicon layers (a-Si: H)[1, 2] deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) is of great interest.

The molecular environment was changed according to the fermentation process in red wines: water–ethanol mixtures with up to 14% vol of ethanol was applied as binary solvent. Two reaction channels were examined according to the order of complex formation. In the first case, the aqueous solutions of malvidin and polyphenols were mixed, then the ethanol content was elevated according to the actual grade of fermentation. In the second case, the stock solutions are prepared as binary solvent mixtures. Our results show a faster formation of the complexes in the former case.

Hardfacing is one of the most useful and economic way to improve the properties and then performance of a component that depends upon the selected alloys for filler and welding process. Shielded metal arc welding is most commonly used process for hardfacing due to its easy availability and versatility. Low carbon steel is widely used as substrate material due to its low cost, weldability and compatibility with the hardfacing materials. In the present work a detailed study was done to investigate the hardfacing effect and to study the behavior of different compositions of electrodes on base metal deposited by Shielded Metal Arc Welding (SMAW) process.

Two energy-efficient approaches have been proposed one is in-situ energy efficient approach, and the other is altruistic energy efficient approach. In the first approach existing nodes in network are only used and in second approach additional nodes called altruists are used. Generally comparison is done with five protocols with respect to these approaches and identifies altruistic DISH to be the right choice since it conserves 40-80 percent of energy, maintains the throughput advantage, and the cost efficiency compared to protocols without this approach is two times more. Our study also shows that an in-situ energy efficient approach is suitable only in certain confined scenarios. When transmit-receive pair wishes to initiate communication, neighboring nodes share their knowledge of channel usage. This helps to considerably reduce collisions and increases throughput significantly. However, it comes at the cost of increased energy consumption since idle nodes have to stay awake to overhear and acquire channel usage information. In fact this can be as high as 264% of a power-saving protocol without cooperation. The core idea is to introduce specialized nodes called altruists in the network whose only role is to acquire and share channel usage information. All other nodes, termed peers, go in to the sleep mode when idle due to this power consumption will be less. This altruistic approach seems to be complicated because it needs additional nodes to be deployed.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'B Sunil Kumar and P SivaChandrika and A Shiva Kumar and K Srinivasulu and Y Rama Krishna', 'eprint': 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.301.5984&rep=rep1&type=pdf', 'title': 'Energy Efficient Approaches: Altruist Energy Efficient Approach is the Best', 'url': 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.301.5984&rep=rep1&type=pdf'}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:3wLP7v6BnpwC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Ad hoc networking is a concept in computer communications, which means that users wanting to communicate with each other form a temporary network, without any form of centralized administration. Each node participating in the network acts both as host and a router and must therefore is willing to forward packets for other nodes. Asynchronous serial communication is an asynchronous serial transmission protocol in which a start signal is sent prior to each byte, character or code word and a stop signal is sent after each code word. The start signal serves to prepare the receiving mechanism for the reception and registration of a symbol and the stop signal serves to bring the receiving mechanism to rest in preparation for the reception of the next symbol. The" stop bit" is actually a" stop period “the stop period of the transmitter may be arbitrarily long. The receiver requires a shorter stop period than the transmitter. At the end of each character, the receiver stops briefly to wait for the next start bit. It is this difference which keeps the transmitter and receiver synchronized. The approach is to detect the multichannel coordination problem (MCC) and vulnerabilities occur in the overall network. In existing, it was implemented by DISH protocol to improve the energy efficiency of the wireless network through multi channel Mac protocol. In proposed system, the Adaptive Energy Efficient protocol is implemented to enhance the wireless network performance by reduce the energy consumption during the data dissemination.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'A Sivanesh Kumar and V Khanaa', 'eprint': 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.680.2732&rep=rep1&type=pdf', 'title': 'Adaptive Energy-Efficient Clustering For Multichannel MAC Protocol', 'url': 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.680.2732&rep=rep1&type=pdf'}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:5UUbrqTvKfUC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr">Page 1.

Leakage power has become a serious concern in nanometer CMOS technologies. Dynamic and leakage power together are the main contributors to the overall power consumption. In the past, the dynamic power has conquered the total power dissipation of CMOS strategy. Though, with the continuous tendency of technology of scaling, leakage power is becoming a main contributor to power consumption so for removing these kind of leakages and to provide a better power efficiency we are using many types of power gating techniques. This paper presents the review on different types of circuits with different types of power gated parameter using low power VLSI design techniques and display the comparison between different nanometer technologies. Dual stack method is reducing both leakage and dynamic powers. also, the dual stack approach shows the least speed power product when compared to the other existing methods.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Nitesh Kumar Kiran and Alok Kumar', 'eprint': 'http://ijsetr.com/uploads/642531Leakage%20Power%20Reduction%20and%20Power%20Delay%20Product%20(PDP)%20Improvement%20using%20Dual%20Stack%20Method.doc', 'title': 'Leakage Power Reduction and Power Delay Product (PDP) Improvement using Dual Stack Method', 'url': 'http://ijsetr.com/uploads/642531Leakage%20Power%20Reduction%20and%20Power%20Delay%20Product%20(PDP)%20Improvement%20using%20Dual%20Stack%20Method.doc'}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:pZ2CosqRuhkC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">This study characterized the influence of Gypsum (CaSO42H20) a chemical fertilizer on Tulsi (Ocimum basilicum) plant.

Two ondemand routing protocols used in Ad-Hoc networks is AODV (Ad-Hoc On demand Distance Vector) protocol and DSR (Dynamic Source Routing) protocol. The security of the AODV protocol is compromised by a particular of attack called “Black Hole” attack. In this attack, a malicious node advertises itself as having the shortest path with highest sequence number to the node whose packets it wants to intercept. To reduce the probability, it is proposed to wait and check the replies from all the neighboring nodes to find a safe route. AODV protocol provides better performance than the DSR in the presence of Black holes with minimal additional delay and Overhead.

As MANETs are infrastuctreless networks it is vulnerable to malicious attacks. The number of nodes that can take part in communication is not restricted in MANETs and also due to rapid node movement occurance, nodes keeps on changing its location autonomously. The topology of MANETs changes continuously and routing tends to be difficult. It is very much essential to provide anonymous routing in ad-hoc networks to preserve the source, destination and route anonymity. Existing routing protocols cannot provide anonymity to nodes as well as to the route, but the proposed system can ensure anonymity to a greater level. Hybrid key encryption techniques are used to encrypt and decrypt the data and forward the data in a secure manner. Efficient encryption techniques helps to prevent from various types of attacks such as timing attack, intersection attack etc. we theoretically analyze the proposed system in terms of anonymity and efficiency. Experimental results shows consistency with theoretical results proving AORPM yields better performance and negligible delay.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'KV Arathi and Poorvi S Alva and KN Akshatha and Anil Kumar and S Shilpashree', 'eprint': 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.684.5209&rep=rep1&type=pdf', 'title': 'AORPM: Anonymity of Routing Path in MANETs', 'url': 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.684.5209&rep=rep1&type=pdf'}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:cTy_cm4PQvYC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) is the most important joining technique used in almost all types of manufacturing sector. GTAW is suitable for welding thin work materials where good quality and surface finish are required. The presence of certain impurities in steel such as sulphur, oxygen etc in the weld pool can significantly reduce the weld penetration depth and limits it for welding upto 4 mm thick sheets only. Several mechanisms have been proposed for producing a relatively deep and narrow weld. A novel variant of GTAW process called the AGTAW process involves application of thin coating (10-15μm thick) of activated flux on the joint area prior to welding. Literature identifies that the penetration capability of the arc in GTAW can be significantly increased by the application of a flux coating containing active ingredients, onto the joint surface prior to welding.

Based on the experiments conducted on L9 orthogonal array, study has been carried out using Taguchi method. Response tables and graphs were used to find the optimal levels of parameters in EDM process. The confirmation experiments were carried out to validate the optimal results. Thus, the machining parameters for EDM were optimized for achieving the combined objectives of higher rate of material removal, lower wear rate on tool, on the work material considered in this work. The obtained results show that the Taguchi method study is being effective technique to find the best machining parameters for EDM process.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Amit Kumar and Abhishek Gaikwad and Amit Tiwari', 'eprint': 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.678.8309&rep=rep1&type=pdf', 'title': 'Study of EDM Parameters on Mild Steel Using Brass Electrode', 'url': 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.678.8309&rep=rep1&type=pdf'}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:sfsSB7lKuh0C', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Biometrics is the technology of identifying uniquely human subjects by means of measuring and analyzing one or more intrinsic behavioral or physical traits.

We then use a client request generator to obtain the client request pattern. We feed these values to an SMPL simulation model for the server.

The number of amplified bands varied from 2 to 10 with a size range of 300-3000bp. Molecular polymorphic was 45.8%. Jatropha curcas L. plant leaf isolates from different geographical locations exhibit almost same level of phylogenetic similarity.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'M Abdurrahman and Anoop Kumar and B Kishor and Zafar Abbas', 'title': 'Journal of Biological and Chemical Research', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10313985810521720714&hl=en&oi=scholarr'}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:U5uP8zs9lfgC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Background: Overactive bladder is symptom syndrome of lower urinary tract dysfunction and has significant social and economic impact on the patients and society.

The steady axisymmetric periodic solution is first obtained using the equations of motion under the assumptions of Flügge-Luré-Byrne nonlinear shell theory. Linearization about this state leads to a linear PDEs with time periodic coefficients. Galerkin projection using possible buckled modes are employed to convert the PDEs to a system of ODEs.

In the present days, most of the vehicles are designed with GSM based vehicle theft control systems, which provides the protection from thefts even if they are parked in the parking area. But major problem with all these system having a major limitation that it can alert local user only not remote. Consider a condition user is far away from vehicle and theft detection siren start then user can’t listen alert and he can’t take any step. And consider a condition owner wants to control his vehicle remotely using any technology it is not possible at this stage. To overcome this type of problem we are trying to implement a system which can used to interact with the system remotely. e. The sensors in the system identifies any anomalies occurred in the system and inform the owner using some messages.

As the earth’s temperature continues to rise, we can expect a significant impact on our fresh water supplies with the potential for devastating effects on food, water and energy. Water scarcity is expected to become an ever-increasing problem in the future, for various reasons. First, the distribution of precipitation in space and time is very uneven, leading to tremendous temporal variability in water resources worldwide. If all the freshwater on the planet were divided equally among the global population, there would be 5,000 to 6,000 cubic metre of water available for everyone, every year. Second, the rate of evaporation varies a great deal, depending on temperature and relative humidity, which impacts the amount of water available to replenish groundwater supplies. The combination of shorter duration but more intense rainfall (meaning more runoff and less infiltration) combined with increased evapotranspiration (the sum of evaporation and plant transpiration from the earth\'s land surface to atmosphere) and increased irrigation is expected to lead to groundwater depletion. This research paper quantifies the possible impacts of the climate change on the water resources within the constraints of the uncertainty of climate change predictions.

Introduction omposite structures are currently being designed to make use of multiple layers of fiber reinforced material. Each layer has a different orientation; but along the layer fibers are oriented in same direction. With new fabrication technology such as computer controlled three-axes filament winding, tape laying machine, and fiber and tow placement technology [1], it is now possible to manufacture fiber such that orientation can be changed point to point in a particular layer. These kinds of fiber are known as curvilinear fiber format in literature. In this project, the advantage of curvilinear fiber design in improving the mechanical properties of structure is explored. To start with, stiffness properties of curvilinear fiber are calculated. These properties turned out to be quite different than that of straight fiber.

On the other hand, branch misprediction halts fetching of useful instructions. The situation becomes worse when we take into account the cache pollution a branch misprediction causes. Branches that depend on a long-latency loads take much longer time to resolve. As a result, mispredicting such branch fills up the pipe with a lot of useless instructions. Finally, when the branch resolves the entire start-up latency comes in the critical path. Several recent studies have speculated that such branches are critical for performance. In this paper, we put this debate to rest by showing that these branches are very small in number and do not affect performance.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Nisheet Jain and Abhas Kumar', 'eprint': 'https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/73d1/e8a1c79e0c5252f0ae4beca9aa2a7dc9357c.pdf', 'title': 'Long-latency Control Dependence: Does it Really Matter?', 'url': 'https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/73d1/e8a1c79e0c5252f0ae4beca9aa2a7dc9357c.pdf'}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:pAkWuXOU-OoC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">As of late, proposal frameworks have seen huge advancement in the field of learning building.

In addition, proposal issue is frequently portrayed by the vicinity of numerous clashing destinations or choice variables, for example, clients\' inclinations and venue closeness. In this scheme, this system proposed MobiContext, a mixture cloud-based Bi-Objective Recommendation Framework (BORF) for portable interpersonal organizations. The MobiContext uses multitarget enhancement systems to create customized suggestions. To deliver the issues relating to chilly begin and information meager condition, the BORF performs information using so as to preprocess the Hub-Average (HA) deduction model. In addition, the Weighted Sum Approach (WSA) is actualized for scalar streamlining and a transformative calculation (NSGA-II) is connected for vector enhancement to give ideal proposals to the clients around a venue.

Advanced spectroscopic and structural studies have been performed since several years to investigate the origin of these protein based radicals. TYR122* is a stable radical that is generated in the R2 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of deoxyribo-nucleotides. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopic experiments performed by Lendzian et al. have shown the orientation of the tyrosyl radical in the active state of E. coli RNR. The different g-tensor values obtained indicate the displacement of the tyrosine radical in the vicinity of the di-iron center, however failed to identify the exact location and orientation of the tyrosyl radical. We applied Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and further mathematical calculations in-silico in order to analyze and interpret the experimental data. The results obtained helped identifying the location and orientation of the tyrosyl radical clarifying the experimental results. For the first time such a comparison was made for the g-factor based orientations obtained from the EPR spectroscopy experiments directly with those of in silico MD-simulations results. This kind of methodology offers a comprehensive knowledge on the structural dynamics of bio molecules and can be easily extended to study other model systems as well.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Gajula MNV Prasad and Heinz-J Steinhoff and Anuj Kumar and Ebrahimali A Siddiq and Anand K Polumetla and Friedhelm Lendzian', 'eprint': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/MNV_Prasad_Gajula/publication/274252479_Displacement_of_the_Tyrosyl_Radical_in_RNR_Enzyme_A_Sophisticated_Computational_Approach_to_Analyze_Experimental_Data/links/5519ad7e0cf2f51a6fea2100/Displacement-of-the-Tyrosyl-Radical-in-RNR-Enzyme-A-Sophisticated-Computational-Approach-to-Analyze-Experimental-Data.pdf', 'title': 'Displacement of the Tyrosyl Radical in RNR Enzyme: A Sophisticated Computational Approach to Analyze Experimental Data', 'url': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/MNV_Prasad_Gajula/publication/274252479_Displacement_of_the_Tyrosyl_Radical_in_RNR_Enzyme_A_Sophisticated_Computational_Approach_to_Analyze_Experimental_Data/links/5519ad7e0cf2f51a6fea2100/Displacement-of-the-Tyrosyl-Radical-in-RNR-Enzyme-A-Sophisticated-Computational-Approach-to-Analyze-Experimental-Data.pdf'}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:ILKRHgRFtOwC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Beziers contribution to computer graphics has covered the road for CAD software.

Despite rapid advances in the synthesis of tool motions in the trajectory, there has been much less research on the issue of fine-tuning for the definition the trajectory to achieve desired smoothness on the work piece. The quality of trajectory will depend upon the clarity of curve. Based upon the lacuna of publication of Bezier curve through MATLAB-10, and the discussion made with industrialized persons, it has been decided to represent the geometry of the trajectory through a suitable MATLAB program that will help full to researcher for designing free form curve. So, this paper presents the modeling of Bezier curve through the parametric concept to define the geometry of the trajectory. The curve has been tested in MATLAB-10 through the proposed program. The control points are the true points which are filtered from the imported IGES neutral file format exported through CATIAV5. Later the shape of the curve is changed globally by changing their control point coordinate value and represented graphically in a clear manner.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Kali Charan Rath and Amaresh Kumar and AM Tigga', 'eprint': 'https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0eb9/ea4a0a833feb51e2e90fb4f41792b010b507.pdf', 'title': 'Self Affine Nature of Freeform Parametric Bezier Curves For Tool Path Generation', 'url': 'https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0eb9/ea4a0a833feb51e2e90fb4f41792b010b507.pdf'}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:ML0RJ9NH7IQC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small">//static.cambridge.org/content/id/urn%3Acambridge.org%3Aid%3Aarticle%3AS0022109015000514/resource/name/firstPage-S0022109015000514a.jpg</div></div>', 'author': 'Nihat Aktas and Eric de Bodt and Helen Bollaert and Richard Roll and Mike Anderson and Adonis Antoniades and Constantinos Antoniou and Glenn W Harrison and Morten I Lau and Daniel Read and George O Aragon and Vikram Nanda', 'title': 'Capital Market Efficiency and Arbitrage Efficacy Ferhat Akbas, Will J.

It deciphers the underlying drives which lead the B-school students to adopt unethical conduct within academic settings. A structured questionnaire was developed towards identifying three dimensions in the context of B-school students-their awareness of what constitutes unethical behavior, the reasons prompting the students to resort to unethical practices in academic settings and probability of their future corporate behavior reflecting unethical conduct. Ethics is majorly viewed as one or other form of moral objectives perceived by respondent group. Inspite of general agreement that presence of ethical conduct in academic settings is important, diverse unethical conducts exists in varying degrees within academic settings. The awareness as to what constitutes Plagiarism is found to be alarmingly low among students. The B-schools may look towards employing suggested means of evaluation and plagiarism detection for thwarting academic cheating practices. Future researches can identify linkage between current ethical orientation of B-school students and their future conduct at respective workplaces. Future researchers may consider frequency of resorting to individual cheating methods towards deriving a classification of academic cheaters.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Pallab Sikdar and Munish Makkad and Amresh Kumar', 'eprint': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vinod_Kumar137/publication/262640375_CSR_Influence_on_Customer_Relational_Outcome_A_Study_of_Indian_Telecom_Industry/links/0deec5385723891475000000.pdf#page=176', 'journal': 'RESEARCH AND SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS', 'pages': '156', 'title': 'Ethical Orientation in Management Education–Evidence from the Indian National Capital Region', 'url': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vinod_Kumar137/publication/262640375_CSR_Influence_on_Customer_Relational_Outcome_A_Study_of_Indian_Telecom_Industry/links/0deec5385723891475000000.pdf#page=176'}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:j8SEvjWlNXcC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Accuracy of machined component is one of the most critical considerations for any manufacturer. Many key factors like cutting tool and machining conditions, resolution of the machine tool, the type of work-piece etc., play an important role. The three major types of errors are geometrical, thermal and cutting-force induced errors. Before we look into the problem, we need to clearly understand what we mean by accuracy and error. Error is defined as the difference between the actual response of the machine to a command issued according to the accepted protocol of that machine’s operation and the response to that command anticipated by the protocol. Accuracy on the other hand, is defined as the degree of conformity of the finished part to dimensional and geometric specifications {Hoken [1]}.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'JANA Dipak Ranjan and Anjani KUMAR and Amaresh KUMAR', 'eprint': 'https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b637/f3d2be340fb9e79e57a0f748d4e4ea719015.pdf', 'title': 'Positional Accuracy Improvement Through Pareto and Cause and Effect Analysis in CNC Machine Tools', 'url': 'https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b637/f3d2be340fb9e79e57a0f748d4e4ea719015.pdf'}, 'id_citations': 'p8phiaYAAAAJ:ZfRJV9d4-WMC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">International Financial Portfolio Diversification has long been the appetite for the investors with financial muscle that can stretch across borders and continents.

The basic advantage of an open economy, which is comparative advantage, leads to various gains such as: efficient allocation of resources, increased overall production, and access to import of capital goods essential for a labor intensive country such as India. In today’s world of changing international trade patterns, it is important for a country to identify the determinants of balance of trade. Identifying the factors determining trade balance can help policy planners to take effective measures to manage trade balance as required for the economy, as also to manage foreign currency exchange rates vis-à-vis other strong currencies so as to give a desirable boost to growth of the economy.

Project financing technique is prominently used for mines, toll road, pipeline, power station, hospital and other infrastructure projects. Past studies show that the Public-Private-Partnership, Take-out Finance, Bond Finance, Securitisation, Viability Gap Funding, and Infrastructure SPV are the prominent project finance structures being used now a day. The foremost advantage of project financing is that it is a nonrecourse financing which results in high leverage for the firms. It also helps in distributing the risk and provides efficient returns in comparison to conventional financing techniques. The shortcoming of project financing is that it is a time consuming process which is relatively expensive. Also, the transactions of project financing are very complex in comparison to traditional corporate financing. With the impact of privatization, deregulation and spread of globalisation project finance has emerged as a key financing technique throughout the world. A year wise analysis of the project finance investment shows that in the year 2004 project finance investment rose by 466.59% over 1994. Region-wise analysis of project financing in the world shows that Western Europe and North America contributed nearly 53% of the total investments in the year 2000 but it was reduced to 36% only by the year 2004.
