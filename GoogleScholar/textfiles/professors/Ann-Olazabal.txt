New World Pasta Company, the court ruled that the phrase “America’s Favorite Pasta” is so-called puffery that does not violate the Lanham Act. Interestingly, this holding puts that court—and its constituent district courts in Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Arkansas, Nebraska, and the Dakotas—at odds with the advertising industry’s self-regulating body, the National Advertising Division (NAD) of the Better Business Bureau, which expects advertisers to support an “America’s Favorite” claim with some type of specific evidence like consumer surveys or sales figures. American Italian Pasta Company (AIPC) advertised its brand, Mueller’s, as “America’s Favorite Pasta.” When a competitor, New World Pasta Company, demanded that AIPC stop using the phrase “America’s Favorite Pasta,” AIPC asked for a court ruling that its use of the phrase did not constitute false or misleading advertising under the …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Ann Morales Olazábal and Anita Cava and René Sacasas and Craig Barkacs', 'eprint': 'http://search.proquest.com/openview/9a86780a907f544b37df0c70f2aee045/1.pdf?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=7397', 'journal': 'Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science', 'number': '4', 'pages': '634-636', 'publisher': 'Sage Publications', 'title': 'Marketing and the Law: Must a Claim to Be “America’s Favorite” Be Verifiable?', 'url': 'https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0092070305279639', 'volume': '33', 'year': 2005}, 'citedby': 1, 'id_citations': 'rJzAvqAAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C', 'id_scholarcitedby': '16568012682583649583', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">From a strategic litigation perspective, the proof required to demonstrate fair use is crucial.

Like other poetic verse, the haiku\'s bounded form serves to dramatize the poem\'s content.

Una de las vías de esa interpretación expansiva radica en la identificación entre vida privada y derecho a la autonomía personal o autodeterminación. Se trata de una construcción que parece inspirarse en la doctrina de la Corte Suprema norteamericana sobre el right to privacy, que identifica un derecho con muy amplios contornos y que el Tribunal de Estrasburgo ha conectado fundamentalmente con el ámbito de la identidad sexual, las decisiones sobre la paternidad y maternidad o la autonomía en el momento de la muerte. Una construcción que suscita importantes problemas, tanto respecto de la propia posición del TEDH y su relación con las Cortes Constitucionales de los Estados miembros, como por la dificultad para fijar un contenido mínimamente claro del nuevo derecho; e, incluso, porque tras ella subyace una concepción de los derechos que parece apartarse de la que durante décadas ha estado en la base de las Constituciones de los Estados miembros y del Convenio mismo.</div><div class="gsh_csp">English Abstract: Over the last decades, the European Court of Human Rights has been carrying out a wide interpretation of the Right to Privacy guaranteed by article 8 of the Convention.

Based on this new construct, the article proposes a rule that places in the locus of scienter a group of corporate agents whose personal scienter, by virtue of their participation in or link to the 10 (b) misrepresentation or omission, is indicative of the corporation’s.
