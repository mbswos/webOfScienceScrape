A review of the crime-costing literature reveals multiple sources, including published articles and government reports, which collectively represent the alternative approaches for estimating the economic losses associated with criminal activity. Many of these sources are based upon data that are more than 10 years old, indicating a need for updated figures. This study presents a comprehensive methodology for calculating the cost to society of various criminal acts. Tangible and intangible losses are estimated using the most current data available.

Based on recent developments by Cohen and colleagues, we adopt a more comprehensive method for estimating the dollar value of avoided criminal activity, taking into account these intangible losses.

Indeed, continued public and private funding is now being linked to cost and performance measures, and programs can use financial data to improve organizational efficiency. However, one of the dangers of promoting cost studies at treatment programs is that most program staff are not technically prepared to perform a cost analysis and little user-friendly information is available to offer assistance. Furthermore, not all cost methods are consistent, which can lead to noncomparable estimates that are difficult to use for policy or planning purposes.

Using unique and recent panel data from waves 1 and 2 of the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) and estimating fixed‐effects models, we find that changes in the unemployment rate are positively related to changes in binge drinking, alcohol‐involved driving, and alcohol abuse and/or dependence.

Concern about workplace productivity, absenteeism, and safety has led many employers to establish employee assistance and drug testing programs. Given the sharp interest in workplace interventions, more information is needed about the relationships between drug use and labor market status. This study estimated the probability of employment and labor force participation for different types of drug users using nationally representative data from the 1997 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse.

First, for many alcoholics, day hospital treatment or even less intensive outpatient services are cost-effective alternatives to inpatient treatment. Second, alcoholism treatment often results in declining health care costs for alcoholics who are covered by private health insurance. Third, though the use of alcoholics anonymous (AA) as an alternative to more structured alcohol treatment services may be cost-effective, substance abuse outcomes from AA are sometimes less favorable and the risk of relapse is higher …</div></div></div></div></div>', 'author': 'Michael T French', 'eprint': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014971899900035X', 'journal': 'Evaluation and Program Planning', 'number': '1', 'pages': '27-39', 'publisher': 'Pergamon', 'title': 'Economic evaluation of alcohol treatment services', 'url': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014971899900035X', 'volume': '23', 'year': 2000}, 'citedby': 85, 'id_citations': 'TlKyiwEAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C', 'id_scholarcitedby': '7580428543097102212', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"> <div class="gsh_csp">Details of the endocrinology of reproduction in the genus <i>Callithrix</i> are known only for the common marmoset, <i>C. jacchus</i>.

The 6-month CREST program cost $1937 for the average participant, and led to ∼30 fewer days incarcerated (29% less) than the average participant in a standard work release program. This implies that the CREST program reduced incarceration for criminal offenders at an average cost of $65 per day.

A variety of outpatient treatments for adolescent substance use disorders have been developed and evaluated. Although no specific treatment modality is effective in all settings, a number of promising adolescent interventions have emerged. As policy makers try to prioritize which programs to fund with limited public resources, the need for systematic economic evaluations of these programs is critical.

To prepare for the next wave of addiction health services research, this article presents background information on the economics of addiction health services, reviews recent empirical and methodological contributions, and provides 15 research recommendations.</div></div></div></div></div>', 'author': 'Michael T French and Michael Drummond', 'eprint': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740547205001182', 'journal': 'Journal of substance abuse treatment', 'number': '2', 'pages': '125-137', 'publisher': 'Pergamon', 'title': 'A research agenda for economic evaluation of substance abuse services', 'url': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740547205001182', 'volume': '29', 'year': 2005}, 'citedby': 46, 'id_citations': 'TlKyiwEAAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '1592332495525088617', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div><div><div class="gsh_csp">The classical approach to methadone treatment is focused on rehabilitation and involves using methadone to stabilize the client physiologically; counseling to address psychosocial needs; and support services to overcome barriers to treatment and a productive life-style. Vocational services traditionally have been included in the latter component as a major factor in enabling clients to become functioning members of society. This paper reviews prior research on vocational services for methadone clients and presents preliminary findings from a randomly controlled trial of a training and employment program with 249 clients in three community-based programs. The results suggest that vocational services can increase access to training and vocational assistance programs significantly, increase school enrollment, and decrease unemployment.</div></div></div></div></div>', 'author': 'Michael L Dennis and Georgia T Karuntzos and Gail L McDougal and Michael T French and Robert L Hubbard', 'journal': 'Evaluation and Program Planning', 'number': '2', 'pages': '73-86', 'publisher': 'Pergamon', 'title': 'Developing training and employment programs to meet the needs of methadone treatment clients', 'url': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0149718993900195', 'volume': '16', 'year': 1993}, 'citedby': 45, 'id_citations': 'TlKyiwEAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '7008529060861075206', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"> <div class="gsh_csp">A benefit–cost analysis of specialty residential treatment (Specialty) and standard residential treatment (Standard) was conducted on a sample of pregnant and parenting substance abusers from Arkansas.

Although research on the effects of mental stress is increasing, few studies offer an economic perspective. In this paper, we examine the effects of job stress on weekly wages and explore the possibility that stress commands a compensating wage differential. Our findings suggest that, ceteris paribus, a wage differential does exist between workers experiencing mental stress and their ‘non-stressed’ cohorts. After controlling for other demographic and occupational factors, we found a statistically significant wage premium ranging from 3 to 10% attributable to mental stress.

Nevertheless, compared to other health care sectors, economic evaluation of addiction treatment is still rare. The present paper proposes two comprehensive economic evaluation instruments that are methodologically sound and that meet the objectives of comprehensiveness, standardization, and comparability.

We used nationally representative data for 12,457 men and 16,061 women to examine associations of PDs with any employment, full‐time employment, chronic unemployment, being fired or laid off, and having trouble with a boss or co‐worker. Antisocial, paranoid, and obsessive‐compulsive PDs demonstrated the broadest patterns of associations with adverse outcomes.

Drug law violators accounted for more than 30% of the increase in incarceration at the state level and 68% of the increase in the federal population (Farabee, et al, 1999). Recent reports estimate that 1,825,000 US residents were incarcerated by the end of 1998 (Simpson, et al., 1999; Beck &amp; Mumola, 1999). Furthermore, the Department of Justice and the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse (CASA) determined that 60-80% of all criminal offenders have used drugs at some point during their lifetime. According to reports for correctional expenditures in 1996, approximately 80 percent ($30 billion) of a $38 billion budget was spent incarcerating individuals who had a history of substance abuse, were convicted of drug law violations, tested positive for drugs when arrested, or …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Kathryn E McCollister and Michael T French', 'eprint': 'http://www.amityfdn.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/1998-McCollistr-French-Cost-of-Criminal-JusticeTreatment.pdf', 'journal': 'Treatment of drug offenders: Policies and issues', 'pages': '22-37', 'publisher': 'Springer Publishing Company, New York', 'title': 'The economic cost of substance abuse treatment in criminal justice settings', 'url': 'http://www.amityfdn.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/1998-McCollistr-French-Cost-of-Criminal-JusticeTreatment.pdf', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 32, 'id_citations': 'TlKyiwEAAAAJ:BqipwSGYUEgC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '5639436861199772104', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div><div><div class="gsh_csp"><b>Purpose:</b> The economic costs of addiction treatment and ancillary services are of great interest to substance abuse treatment providers, researchers, and policymakers.

This study investigates four methods of disseminating quality improvement (QI) to addiction treatment programs in the U.S. It is, to our knowledge, the largest study of organizational change ever conducted in healthcare. The trial seeks to determine the most cost-effective method of disseminating quality improvement in addiction treatment. The study is evaluating the costs and effectiveness of different QI approaches by randomizing 201 addiction-treatment programs to four interventions. Each intervention used a web-based learning kit plus monthly phone calls, coaching, face-to-face meetings, or the combination of all three. Effectiveness is defined as reducing waiting time (days between first contact and treatment), increasing program admissions, and increasing continuation in treatment. Opportunity costs will be estimated for the resources associated with providing the services. The study has three primary outcomes: waiting time, annual program admissions, and continuation in treatment. Secondary outcomes include: voluntary employee turnover, treatment completion, and operating margin.

Although a large body of literature clearly demonstrates the clinical and economic benefits of addiction treatment for many clients and in most settings, the general public has a somewhat ambivalent attitude toward treatment expansion and taxpayer financing. A potential reason for this disconnect between economic evidence and public opinion is a weak identification with the need for, or the success of, addiction treatment for those individuals without a substance abuse problem themselves or in members of their family. Alternatively, addiction treatment stakeholders may be delivering an ineffective or misdirected message about the social value of this industry.

Moreover, tattooed images are permanent unless the individual opts for expensive, time consuming, and painful removal procedures. Given the increasing popularity of tattooing, and the permanent nature of this action, it is of interest to know whether tattooed workers are more or less likely to be employed and, conditional on employment, if they receive wages that are different from the wages of their non‐tattooed peers. To investigate these questions, we analyze two large data sets—from the United States and Australia—with measures of tattoo status, employment, earnings, and other pertinent variables. Regardless of country, gender, specific measures, or estimation technique, the results consistently show that having a tattoo is negatively and significantly related to employment and earnings in …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Michael T French and Johanna Catherine Maclean and Philip K Robins and Bisma Sayed and Leah Shiferaw', 'eprint': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/soej.12132', 'journal': 'Southern Economic Journal', 'number': '4', 'pages': '1212-1246', 'title': 'Tattoos, employment, and labor market earnings: Is there a link in the ink?', 'url': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/soej.12132', 'volume': '82', 'year': 2016}, 'citedby': 9, 'id_citations': 'TlKyiwEAAAAJ:sNmaIFBj_lkC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '4303427164884808042', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"> <div class="gsh_csp">Few studies have examined the long-term patterns of health services utilization and cost for alcohol use disorders.

Direct observation will be used as the gold-standard comparison for each of the three methods. This trial will recruit 135 therapists in approximately 12 community agencies in the City of Philadelphia. Therapists will be randomized to one of the three conditions. Each therapist will provide data from three unique sessions, for a total of 405 sessions. All sessions will be audio-recorded and coded using the Therapy Process Observational Coding System for Child Psychotherapy-Revised Strategies scale. This will enable comparison of each measurement approach to direct observation of therapist session behavior to determine which most accurately assesses fidelity.

Surprisingly, some studies have found a positive association between substance use and earnings (for example, Berger and Leigh 1988; Kaestner 1993, 1994; French and Zarkin 1995; Heien 1996; Zarkin et al. 1998a). While it is difficult to reconcile a positive relationship between substance use and earnings, plausible hypotheses may be consistent with the insignificant results. First, it is possible that substance use may affect physical and emotional abilities, but these factors may not be important determinants of workers\' productivity in some workplace situations. Second, substance use may affect productivity, but employers may be unable to adjust workers\' wages (at least in the short run) to reflect performance changes. Wages are complex in many organizations and it may take several months or years before employers recognize that a worker has a substance use problem. Finally, it is possible that existing statistical models and data sets are not well suited to uncovering the influence of substance use. on wages or productivity.

We wish to make two comments about Robinson\'s paper. First, contrary to what Robinson states, there is an extensive literature demonstrating that workers on more hazardous jobs re-ceive greater wages, holding other worker characteristics constant (eg, education, experience). 2-5 However, since worker characteristics differ, the typical worker ona hazardous job may receive less take-home pay than the typical worker on a safer job.

These adverse conditions are often linked to emotional and physical problems at home, in the classroom, and in the workplace. Recently, economists and other social scientists have begun to explore the labor market effects of substance use through statistical analyses of large national data sets and worksite-specific samples. Contrary to popular belief and earlier econometric studies, most of the current research is finding a positive or insignificant effect of substance use of earnings. However, other studies have found that substance use has a statistically significant effect on labor supply, absenteeism, retention, and various job performance measures.

We employ over 20 years of administrative data from the national Fatal Accident Reporting System coupled with a differences-in-differences research design to investigate the potential spillover effects of parity laws to traffic safety.

Most studies, however, report cross-sectional associations and rarely control for such important predictors as physical activity, socioeconomic status, and alcohol and other drug use. Using data from Waves III (N= 13,038) and IV (N= 13,972) of the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health, we estimate fixed-effects models to more rigorously study the relationships between marijuana use and body mass index over time. Our analyses include numerous sensitivity tests using alternative estimation techniques and at Wave IV we investigate the relationship between marijuana use and an alternative measure of body size (waist circumference). Results show that daily female marijuana users have a BMI that is approximately 3.1%(p&lt; 0.01) lower than that of non-users, whereas daily male users have a BMI that is approximately 2.7%(p&lt; 0.01) lower than that of non-users. The present study indicates a negative association between marijuana use and BMI. Uncovering a negative association between marijuana use and weight status is a valuable contribution to the literature, as this result contradicts those from some previous studies, which were unable to address time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity. Future theory-based research is necessary to explore the metabolic and behavioral pathways underlying the negative associations between marijuana use and BMI. A broader understanding of such mechanisms along with causal estimates will be most helpful to both policymakers and clinicians.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Isabelle C Beulaygue and Michael T French', 'journal': 'The journal of mental health policy and economics', 'number': '3', 'pages': '123-140', 'title': 'Got Munchies?

Using state-level longitudinal data from 1975 to 2005, we estimate how the adoption and repeal of UHLs influence motorcycle safety. Our results confirm earlier findings that adoption of UHLs prevents fatalities, whereas repeals lead to higher fatality rates. We provide evidence that UHLs operate as intended, decreasing fatalities mainly by improving safety rather than by reducing motorcycle riding. Finally, using dynamic specifications, we show that the long-term effects of both adoption and repeal persist in the years beyond the policy change.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Michael T French and Gulcin Gumus and Jenny F Homer', 'pages': '139-162', 'publisher': 'Emerald Group Publishing Limited', 'title': 'Chapter 7 Universal Helmet Laws and Motorcycle Fatalities: A Longitudinal Analysis of Policy Changes', 'url': 'https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/S0573-8555(2010)0000290010', 'year': 2010}, 'citedby': 1, 'id_citations': 'TlKyiwEAAAAJ:mvPsJ3kp5DgC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '13665985787918932424', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Although evaluation methods for health care programs have been fairly well developed, it is often claimed that the standard methods of clinical and economic evaluation cannot be easily applied to adolescent addiction programs.

In prisons, where a majority of substance-using offenders do not receive treatment, identifying an equally effective high-volume alternative such as TES can greatly expand access to quality psychosocial interventions.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Michael Chaple and Stanley Sacks and Karen McKendrick and Lisa A Marsch and Steven Belenko and Carl Leukefeld and Michael Prendergast and Michael French', 'eprint': 'https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0032885516636858', 'journal': 'The Prison Journal', 'number': '3', 'pages': '485-508', 'publisher': 'SAGE Publications', 'title': 'A Comparative Study of the Therapeutic Education System for Incarcerated Substance-Abusing Offenders', 'url': 'https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0032885516636858', 'volume': '96', 'year': 2016}, 'id_citations': 'TlKyiwEAAAAJ:4vMrXwiscB8C', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr">Office Address: University of Miami, Department of Sociology, 5202 University Drive, Merrick \nBuilding, Room 121F, PO Box 248162, Coral Gables, Florida, 33124-2030 Office Address: University \nof Miami, Department of Health Sector Management and Policy, 5250 University Drive, Jenkins \nRoom 417K, PO Box 248223, Coral Gables, Florida, 33124 Office Phone: (305) 284-6039 or \n(305) 284-2296 Office Fax: (305) 284-5310 e-mail: mfrench@miami.edu Current Academic \nRank: Professor (tenure) Primary Departments: Sociology; Health Sector Management and Policy \nSecondary Departments: Economics; Public Health Sciences Citizenship: USA … Ph.D., \nEconomics, Boston College, Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, 1986.

Accounting costs or direct expenditures differ from economic costs because the latter are linked directly to resource utilization. This presentation will outline the principles of economic cost estimation, and then apply these principles in comparing the costs of two substance abuse treatment interventions; ie,(1) experimental (E), the therapeutic education system, a computerized substance abuse intervention, vs.(2) control (C), standard care, group therapy delivered by a certified addictions counselor. The two interventions (E and C) were delivered in a randomized clinical trial conducted among incarcerated substance abusing offenders in 10 prisons located in four states.

This paper examines organizational predictors of on-site HCV testing services in a 2011 nationally-representative sample of opioid treatment programs (OTPs)(N= 200). Results show that 68% of OTPs had the capacity (presence of staff who draw venous blood) to offer HCV testing, however; only one-third actually did so. Further, HCV testing is widespread in facilities affiliated with a hospital, in public facilities, in programs with fewer than 75% IDU clients, and in programs that provide methadone treatment. Implications will be discussed for closing the HCV testing gap in OTPs, which entails significant missed opportunities for case-finding, prevention and early treatment, and is a key challenge to reducing the burden of HCV in the US population. http://dx. doi. org/10.1016/j …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Kathryn E McCollister', 'journal': 'Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment', 'number': '3', 'pages': 'e11-e12', 'publisher': 'Elsevier', 'title': 'Cost-effectiveness analysis of recovery management checkups: Continuing care for adults with substance use disorders', 'url': 'https://www.journalofsubstanceabusetreatment.com/article/S0740-5472(12)00199-7/abstract', 'volume': '43', 'year': 2012}, 'id_citations': 'TlKyiwEAAAAJ:0KyAp5RtaNEC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Research suggests that alcohol use and certain sleep problems co-exist, but most of the literature is descriptive with small sample sizes.

Our models also include a rich set of socioeconomic, demographic, physical health, and mental health variables to control for confounding factors. Our results confirm that alcohol use, and specifically binge drinking, is positively and significantly associated with various types of sleep problems.

Results of this study suggest that the relationship between mobility and attachment differs in relation to an individual\'s age. It was found that mobility detracts from place attachment for older workers but does the opposite for younger workers.

Most of this literature has underscored the importance of parental investments and of preschool education during the early stages of life. Adolescence is another critical period in the formation of skills, where peers have a particularly influential role. In this paper we estimate the role of parents and peers on the development of cognitive and non-cognitive skills using a version of Cunha and Heckman’s (2008) technology of skill formation. Identification of peer effects is based on the quasi-random assignment of students across classes, the dissociation of individual and peer outcomes over time, and the use of instrumental variables to account for common shocks. We find that parents continue to exert a positive impact on their kids during adolescence, promoting academic development and life satisfaction. The influence of parents is, however, stronger in outcomes less likely to be observable and penalized by peers (such as life-satisfaction) and much smaller than the effect of peers in those outcomes subject to peer influence (ie academic performance).</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Ana I Balsa and Michael T French', 'eprint': 'http://www.um.edu.uy/docs/Peer_effects_vs_parental_influence_on_the_development_of_capabilities_in_adolescence.pdf', 'title': 'FACULTAD DE CIENCIAS EMPRESARIALES Y ECONOMIA', 'url': 'http://www.um.edu.uy/docs/Peer_effects_vs_parental_influence_on_the_development_of_capabilities_in_adolescence.pdf', 'year': 2011}, 'id_citations': 'TlKyiwEAAAAJ:yFnVuubrUp4C', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'author': 'M Fraser and F Lovell and M French and S Scott and D Nelson and A McLellan', 'pages': 'S448-S449', 'publisher': 'SPRINGER LONDON LTD', 'title': 'EVALUATION OF OUTCOMES IN 30,000 FRACTURE PATIENTS ASSESSED DURING THE FIRST 10 YEARS OF THE NORTH GLASGOW FRACTURE LIAISON SERVICE', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5923779953694788015&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'volume': '21', 'year': 2010}, 'id_citations': 'TlKyiwEAAAAJ:BUYA1_V_uYcC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp"><h3 class="gsh_h3">Purpose:</h3><div class="gsh_csp"></div> This paper estimates the effects of alcohol consumption on self-reported overall health status, injuries, heart problems, emergency room use, and hospitalizations among persons over the age of 65. <h3 class="gsh_h3">Design and Methods:</h3><div class="gsh_csp"></div> Data from the first wave of the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), a nationally representative study, were analyzed.

Eight independent demographic, health status, and drug use variables were entered into three logistic regression models to determine independent factors associated with these outcomes. <h3 class="gsh_h3">Results:</h3><div class="gsh_csp"></div> Drug use (IDU and OCDU), being female, having insurance, and poorer health were independently associated with need for care. Non-use of drugs, having insurance, being female, and poorer health were independently associated with utilization of treatment-seeking care. Drug use (IDU and OCDU), having insurance, and poorer health status were independently associated with not receiving needed health care. <h3 class="gsh_h3">Conclusions:</h3><div class="gsh_csp"></div> Drug users have a demand for care, are less likely to receive care, and are less likely to receive needed care than are non-users. Interventions are needed to integrate chronic drug users into the health care system and to work with health care providers to increase their sensitivity to the needs of drug users and to emphasize the importance of establishing a continuity of care.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'DD Chitwood and MT French and DC McBride and M Comerford and LR Metsch', 'journal': 'Problems of Drug Dependence: Proceedings of the...

This paper presents consistent and comparable cost data from case studies of EAPs at seven worksites. Because the same data collection instruments and methods were used to collect cost data at each worksite, the data can be used to directly compare cost estimates across programs. The key findings show that EAPs exhibit some economies of scale, that labor costs account for the majority of EAP costs regardless of the services offered, and that EAPs with similar costs per eligible employee may use a substantially different mix of resources. In addition to the cost analyses, the case study findings are compared to recently reported national estimates of EAP costs. The results of this study will help policy makers and employers determine the range of EAP costs for different types of services.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Jeremy W Bray and Michael T French and Brad J Bowland and Laura J Dunlap and JW Bray and MT French and BJ Bowland and LJ Dunlap', 'eprint': 'https://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/J_Bray_Cost_Employee_Assistance_1996.pdf', 'title': 'The Cost of Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs)', 'url': 'https://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/J_Bray_Cost_Employee_Assistance_1996.pdf'}, 'id_citations': 'TlKyiwEAAAAJ:43bX7VzcjpAC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr">1 Polypharmacy and Risk if Non-Fatal Overdose for Patients with HIV Infection and Substance \nDependence Theresa W.

Since then, only one randomized trial has been published comparing mixedugender programs to those designed exclusively for women (Dahlgren &amp; Willander 1989). That study, conducted in Sweden in 1983-1984, found less drinking and better social adjustment at the 2-year follow-up for those randomized to the women’s program. Its findings supported the compelling arguments that have been made to justify distinct, speciaiized treatment for women (reviewed below). Until now, however, these results had not been replicated.

The delivery of mental health services through structured employee assistance programs (EAPs) could be undermined by revised health insurance contracts and cutbacks in employer-provided benefits at the workplace. This study uses two recently completed national surveys of EAPs to estimate the costs of providing EAP services during 1993 and 1995. EAP costs are determined by program type, worksite size, industry, and region. In addition, information on program services is reported to determine the most common types and categories of services and whether service delivery changes have occurred between 1993 and 1995. The results of this study will be useful to EAP managers, mental health administrators, and mental health services researchers who are interested in the delivery and costs of EAP services.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Michael T French and Gary A Zarkin and Jeremy W Bray and Tyler D Hartwell and MT French and GA Zarkin and JW Bray and TD Hartwell', 'eprint': 'https://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/J_Bray_Cost_Employee_1999.pdf', 'title': 'Cost of employee assistance programs: Comparison of national estimates from 1993 and', 'url': 'https://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/J_Bray_Cost_Employee_1999.pdf'}, 'id_citations': 'TlKyiwEAAAAJ:YohjEiUPhakC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">PURPOSE</div><div class="gsh_csp">Partly in reaction to heavy alcohol use and illicit drug use by some workers,“2 many employers have created employee assistance programs (EAPs) to address the variety of problems posed by substance use.
