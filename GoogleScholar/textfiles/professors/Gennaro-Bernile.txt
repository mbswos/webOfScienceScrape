CEOs who experience fatal disasters without extremely negative consequences lead firms that behave more aggressively, whereas CEOs who witness the extreme downside of disasters behave more conservatively. These patterns manifest across various corporate policies including leverage, cash holdings, and acquisition activity.

This is the first large sample study on the information content of these forecasts.

There are, however, significant differences across industries: when the target is a regulated utility, the stock market capitalizes incremental forecasts dollar for dollar, as opposed to only 35 cents on the dollar, in other cases. In this latter sample, my analysis shows that the information conveyed by insiders’ projections, although limited, is incremental relative to other public signals. In particular, the evidence is consistent with the idea that managers’ merger-related forecasts offer a rationale for the premium paid to target shareholders and this, in turn, benefits bidder shareholders. Moreover, consistent with the hypothesis that costly signaling enhances the credibility of voluntary disclosure, merger-related projections are more informative, and bidder shareholders gain more from their release, when a deal is financed through an all-cash offer. Finally, and again consistent with the tenets of the cheap talk literature, the information content of bidder insiders’ forecasts is directly related to managers’ equity holdings. In summary, although the reliability of insiders’ projections displays considerable variation, the analysis shows that merger-related cash flow forecasts are value-relevant, and increasingly so as acquiring firms, and their managers, have more at stake.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Gennaro Bernile', 'eprint': 'https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2e30/cbb2dadbc8c5118715fa1f69e44886e6b528.pdf', 'journal': 'EFA 2005 Moscow Meetings Paper', 'title': 'The information content of insiders’ forecasts: analysis of the gains from mergers in the 90s', 'url': 'https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2e30/cbb2dadbc8c5118715fa1f69e44886e6b528.pdf', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 17, 'id_citations': 'lkBJH-YAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C', 'id_scholarcitedby': '914058171455349861', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Using information from 10-K filings of public firms, we identify economic connections among US states.

In particular, we provide the first analysis of how merger synergies propagate through the supply chain by utilizing a novel dataset of insiderstpro (jections of merger (related operating effi ciencies. Based on a simple oligopolistic competition model, we show theoretically that omitting synergies from the empirical analysis of the anticompetitive effects of mergers along the supply chain can lead to biased inferences. Indeed, our empirical tests indicate that both merger (related changes in industry competition and improvements in operat (ing effi ciency are important determinants of the wealth of rivals, customers, and suppliers around horizontal merger announcements. Specifically, while product market rivals tend to benefit from re (duced competition and suffer from merging firmstprospected effi ciency improvements, the opposite is true for merging firmstlikely customers and suppliers. Finally, we extend the existing literature by providing a first analysis of the wealth effects of vertical mergers along the supply chain.

Consistent with this conjecture, we find that following regulatory changes there is a sharp decline in the ability of local investors to generate abnormal returns from their local investments. Concurrently, the excess local holdings of institutional investors decline by a half and ownership becomes more diffused geographically.

We find that the monthly volatility of fund returns decreases by roughly 50 bps during the year after a disaster and this effect gradually dissipates by the fourth year after the event. This decrease is primarily due to lower systematic risk. Additional results rule out explanations based on wealth effects and managerial agency, skill, or catering. Overall, the evidence indicates that extreme events can cause large albeit transient changes in attitudes toward financial risk, even for professionals who deal with such risk for a living.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'GENNARO BERNILE and VINEET BHAGWAT and AMBRUS KECSKÉS and PHUONG-ANH NGUYEN', 'eprint': 'https://efmaefm.org/0EFMAMEETINGS/EFMA%20ANNUAL%20MEETINGS/2017-Athens/papers/EFMA2017_0087_fullpaper.pdf', 'title': 'Do Catastrophic Experiences Affect Risk Attitudes?

Our conjecture is that true investment skill would not depend upon geographical proximity between investors and firms, while opportunistic access to information is likely to be location-dependent. Thus, if institutions are truly skilled, they would earn high average return and exhibit performance persistence in both their local and nonlocal trades. Our evidence indicates that institutions on average are not skilled and their superior intraquarter performance is more likely to reflect opportunistic access to shortterm local information. They have high average local performance but this performance is not persistent. Further, we observe increased local trading activity and profitability prior to earnings announcements, particularly before negative news. In contrast, the average net nonlocal intraquarter trading profits are not significantly different from zero. There is persistence in non-local performance, however, which suggests that some investors in the cross-section may be skilled. Specifically, investors with superior non-local performance exhibit superior future performance in both non-local and local trades. This evidence indicates that superior performance in non-local trades is a better indicator of innate trading skill.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Gennaro BERNILE and Alok Kumar and Johan Sulaeman and Qin Wang', 'eprint': 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.650.7575&rep=rep1&type=pdf', 'pages': '1977-1984', 'title': 'Are Institutional Investors Really Skilled or Merely Opportunistic?.(2013).

Our empirical evidence generally supports the predictions of a stylized model that we develop to analyze the effects of merger synergies on firms having output or input market linkages with the merging companies and/or with their product market rivals. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that merger synergies are an important determinant of the stock market reaction and of the post-merger change in operating performance of merging firms’ product market rivals, customers, and suppliers, a claim that has been made in the past with very limited empirical support.

We develop a model that links exposure and disclosure to investor attention, asset ownership, and asset returns in a rational setting. Our empirical tests support the model’s main intuition that investors’ attention to a particular firm is an increasing function of the proximity of potential investors to the firm’s locations (exposure) and the informativeness of the firm’s financial statement (disclosure quality). As a result, a firm’s exposure and disclosure affect shareholders’ dispersion and trading intensity. Moreover, stock returns are strongly related to potential investors’ concentration around the firm headquarters. Firms whose HQ’s are located far from potential investors outperform those located near potential investors by up to 0: 68 percent monthly on a value-weighted basis. This strong relation, however, is significantly tempered by greater firm’s non-HQ exposure or higher disclosure quality. Overall, we show that a firm’s proximity to potential investors and its disclosure quality have a large impact on the firm’s ownership dispersion and stock returns, and that these determinants of investors’ attention on the firm are to a large extent substitutes.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Gennaro BERNILE and Shimon Kogan and Johan Sulaeman', 'title': 'Do Exposure and Disclosure Affect Ownership Concentration and Equity Returns?', 'url': 'https://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/lkcsb_research/3779/', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'lkBJH-YAAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'author': 'Gennaro Bernile and Alok Kumar and Johan Sulaeman and Qin Wang', 'journal': 'Available at SSRN 2102078', 'title': 'Fleeting Local Information: Intraquarter Trading and Performance of Local Institutional Investors', 'year': 2012}, 'id_citations': 'lkBJH-YAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">This paper shows that the geographical location of a firm affects its liquidity.
