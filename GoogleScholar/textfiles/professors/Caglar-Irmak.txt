The authors demonstrate the conditions in which CM campaigns that allow consumers to choose the cause that receives the donation lead to greater consumer support than those in which the company determines the cause. They show that choice in this context is helpful as long as it increases consumers’ perception of personal role in helping the cause. Specifically, allowing consumers to select the cause in a CM campaign is more likely to enhance perceived personal role and, thus, purchase intentions (1) for those consumers who are high (vs. low) in collectivism and (2) when the company and causes have low (vs. high) perceptual fit.

Four studies demonstrate that when a food is identified by a relatively unhealthy name (e.g., pasta), dieters perceive the item to be less healthful and less tasty than do nondieters. When the identical food is assigned a relatively healthy name (e.g., salad), however, dieting tendency has no effect on product evaluations. This effect, which results in differences in actual food consumption, is explained by nondieters’ insensitivity to food cues as well as dieters’ reliance on cues indicating a lack of healthfulness and tendency to employ heuristic information processing when evaluating foods.

This research examines the role of consumers’ need for uniqueness (CNFU) in two common social comparisons: projection and introjection. Consumers project (i.e., rely on their own preferences to estimate those of others), regardless of their CNFU. However, high-CNFU consumers are less likely than low-CNFU ones to introject (i.e., rely on estimates of others’ preferences to gauge their own). Moreover, alleviating the introjection-induced threat to the high-CNFU consumers’ self-concept by having them deliberate on their differentness from others increases their likelihood of introjection.

The implications of such projection processes, wherein the self serves as the standard of comparison, are well explored in extant consumer behavior literature (Ames and Iyengar 2005; Davis, Hoch, and Ragsdale 1986; Hoch 1987, 1988). Less understood, and relatively less examined, is the manner in which individuals incorporate others’ product preferences into their own via projection processes that consider others as the comparison referent. For example, consumers estimate the opinions of others to arrive at standards that they chose to comply with (eg, refraining from purchasing an item they predict their friends will dislike in order to conform to the group) or ignore (eg, selecting that same item in order to self-differentiate). The desire to conform or differentiate varies based on an individual’s need for uniqueness (NFU), defined as the self-esteem driven need to maintain a sense of at least moderate distinctiveness within one’s social milieu (Snyder and Fromkin 1977). In the consumer domain, it has been demonstrated that high NFU individuals have stronger preferences for unique products relative to low NFU individuals (Ames and Iyengar 2005; Tian, Bearden, and Hunter 2001). More complex and less understood, however, is the role of NFU in people’s benchmarking of self-other preferences. Prior research has yielded contradictory results regarding the effect of NFU on social projection. On the one hand, research demonstrates that NFU moderates individuals’ projection of traits (Kernis 1984); on the other hand, it is perceived similarity, rather than NFU, that …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Caglar Irmak and Beth Antonuk Vallen and Sankar Sen', 'eprint': 'http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/v35/naacr_vol35_282.pdf', 'journal': 'ACR North American Advances', 'title': 'The role of uniqueness motivations in social comparison processes', 'url': 'http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/13424/volumes/v35/NA-35', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 2, 'id_citations': '34ZxWyAAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '3033406940197068822', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">The purpose of this research is to investigate the underlying mechanism of the placebo effect, which is defined as a genuine physiological effect that is attributable to receiving a substance or undergoing a procedure, but is not due to the inherent powers of that substance or procedure (Stewart-Williams and Podd 2004).

For example, continued browsing might expose consumers to information that is unknown for an option they already placed in their shopping cart. How might preference strength affect their reactions to such missing information on their prior choices? Much research suggests that consumers with strong prior preferences are likely to employ motivated reasoning to bolster and retain the preliminary choice. However, we document a heretofore unexamined condition under which those with relatively stronger prior preferences for an incumbent are more likely to abandon it than those with weaker prior preferences. We argue that this occurs because those with relatively stronger (vs. weaker) prior preferences experience more cognitive dissonance when information on new attributes is missing on just the …</div></div></div></div></div>', 'author': 'Caglar Irmak and Thomas Kramer and Sankar Sen', 'eprint': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105774081630047X', 'journal': 'Journal of Consumer Psychology', 'number': '2', 'pages': '264-269', 'publisher': 'No longer published by Elsevier', 'title': 'Choice under incomplete information on incumbents: Why consumers with stronger preferences are more likely to abandon their prior choices', 'url': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105774081630047X', 'volume': '27', 'year': 2017}, 'citedby': 1, 'id_citations': '34ZxWyAAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '15632939288621592905', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"> <div class="gsh_csp">Pharmaceutical non-adherence is a major issue in both the United States and worldwide.

This conflict between purchase and usage behavior is explained by the complexity of product features. Consumers underestimate learning costs at the time of purchase (Meyer, Zhao, and Han 2008) and fail to take the usability factors into account (Thompson, Hamilton, and Rust 2005) when they purchase multifunctional products. Consumer research on multifunctional products thus far has focused on consumer reactions to products with novel and complex features (Mukherjee and Hoyer 2001; Thompson et al. 2005). However, in many product markets (eg, mobile phones, vacation resorts) consumers shop for products with multiple, yet simple, features. When consumers are familiar with a product and its features, they are less likely to underestimate learning costs and usability is unlikely to be a factor in product choice (Kahn and Meyer 1991). Still, even for simple product purchases, for instance, when choosing between pay-per-use and a flat fee for using a swimming pool, consumers often overestimate higher-than-average usage incidents, leading them to overpay for such products (Nunes 2000). Thus, research suggests that consumers are generally poor in accurately predicting their usage rate of products and product features before purchase.</div><div class="gsh_csp">We build on this body of research by testing whether consumers fail to estimate (rather than underestimate) their usage rate of product features.

The authors find that when the notion of rarity is salient, non-impulsive consumers’ tendency to indulge increases, but it does not affect indulgence tendencies of impulsive consumers. This effect occurs because, for non-impulsives, the actual act of indulging is a relatively rare occurrence—it is something that happens with low frequency.

Compensatory control theory (CCT; Kay and Eibach 2013) proposes that behavior following a loss of control is driven by to two basic motivations: bolstering a sense of agency, and affirming structured and predictable relationships in the world. In turn, four strategies serve these two motivations (Landau, Kay, and Whitson 2015). The present research builds on the two strategies for bolstering agency, which are (1) affirming beliefs about personal agency or ability, and (2) affiliating with external entities that can act on the self’s behalf. Specifically, we build on prior work showing that control-deprived consumers evaluate products more favorably when those products have characteristics fitting the motivation to affirm personal agency (ie,“strategy 1”). For example, products requiring effort are evaluated more favorably because using them is empowering (Cutright and Samper 2014), and utilitarian products are evaluated more favorably because they are associated with problem-solving (Chen et al. 2014). Extant research has not examined the possibility that products can serve as external sources of control (ie,“strategy 2”); research in this strategy focuses on cultural sources of control (eg, religion and governments; Kay and Eibach 2013).

In the first paper, Davis and Haws show that not receiving nutritional information impacts consumers’ enjoyment of hedonic foods, an effect they term “motivated ignorance.” Their studies show that consumers who are lower in eating self-control seek less and spend less time evaluating nutritional information relating to unhealthy foods to avoid the hedonic cost of this information and increase predicted and actual enjoyment of the foods.

For example, recent research shows that conservative consumers shop at Walmart more often while liberal consumers go to Starbucks more often (Gelman 2008). Despite the fact that political ideologies are one of the important drivers determining our daily life consumption behaviors, it is surprising that a few researchers in the consumer literature have recently begun to empirically examine how political ideology influences consumer behavior in daily life (eg, Fernandes and Mandel 2013, Khan et al. 2013, Kidwell et al. 2013). To address this gap, the papers comprising this session proposal are designed to answer the following question:“How does political ideology affect a wide variety of consumers’ reaction and behaviors (ie, choices, persuasion, unhealthy behavior, and donation)?” The first paper by Farmer and his colleagues examines how differences in political ideology impact consumer choices. They found that liberals preferred hedonic, novel, and desirable options while conservatives preferred utilitarian, status quo and feasible options.

When consumers do give, approximately 50% are motivated to only give once and not give again (Nonprofit Times 2003). In order to continue to serve those in need, charities must effectively request help from donors. Consumers are more likely to engage in helping behavior when they will receive a positive emotional response (Batson 1998; Piliavin et al. 1981). However, research has not addressed whether consumers are accurate in their forecasts. Affective misforecasting is the difference between forecasted and experienced affect (Patrick, MacInnis, and Park 2007). There are several different biases that have been associated with misforecasting; however, they do not tap into the key drivers of prosocial behavior: the costs endured by the giver and benefit received by the person (s) in need (Piliavin et al. 1981). When consumers think about helping others, consumers are more likely to focus on the benefit to others. The focus of benefitting others is likely to induce predictions of positive affect as research has shown that thinking about the benefit to others produces strong feelings of positive affect (Salovey et al. 1991). When consumers experience the helping behavior, consumers are more likely to focus on the process to self. With prosocial behavior, consumers do not see the outcome produced to those in need. Therefore, they use their endured costs to inform the provided benefit. The cost-benefit inference is not taken under consideration during time of prediction.

In line with such findings, we contend that, when faced with an opportunity to indulge, consumers may be motivated to distort their memories to fabricate progress toward a pertinent self-regulatory goal, allowing themselves to indulge in the present. Further, because such a situation is more likely to arise in the case of competing goals, we predict that those who are high in impulsivity, who chronically have indulgence goals (Ramanathan and Menon 2006) and thus, often experience conflicts between short-term pleasure versus long-term self-regulatory goals (Mukhopadhyay et al. 2008), are more likely to employ such memory distortions than those who are low in impulsivity.

In a particularly dramatic example, Langer and Rodin (1976) showed allowing nursing home residents an ability to choose among seemingly inconsequential options, such as on which of two possible dates they will watch a particular movie, dramatically improved both their well being and longevity. From a practical perspective, service providers and retailers are often encouraged to empower consumers to choose for themselves. We propose that such empowerment can backfire and impair the effectiveness of the chosen option. This prediction builds on the theories of Option Attachment (Carmon et al. 2003), and Placebo Effects of Marketing Actions (Shiv et al. 2005). Research on Option Attachment suggests that empowering consumers to make choices involving significant conflict among the choice alternatives can lead to post-decision discomfort with the chosen option and an increase in the appeal of rejected options. And research on Placebo Effects of Marketing Actions shows that changes in consumer expectations about the effectiveness of products they are to consume can influence the actual efficacy of those products. In light of those theories, we propose that choosing among choice alternatives can hurt expectations for, and confidence in, the efficacy of the selected option and as a result of a negative placebo effect lessen the actual efficacy of the chosen option.

For instance, Calvin Klein’s fragrance CK1 is marketed as “unisex,” targeting both men and women. APG’s Snuggie is labeled as “one size fits all.” implying that the same blanket can accommodate a range of adult body types. Such all-inclusive labels point to the “all-fitting” aspect of the product, thereby resulting in the expansion of the potential customer pool. However, we argue in this research that marketers may unintentionally be driving customers away with their omnibus labeling practices because allinclusive labels communicate to customers that the product is likely to be purchased by not only them but also all sorts of other consumers who may not be like them. We focus on this effect of target market specificity or generality on consumer reactions to such products and develop a counter-intuitive argument that leaving the target market of the product ambiguous may actually benefit marketers. Previous research has shown that consumers avoid products or behaviors associated with dissociative reference groups, or groups with whom they want to avoid being confused (Berger and Heath 2007, 2008; Simmel 1904/1957; White and Dahl 2006, 2007). Men in a restaurant, for example, avoided steaks labeled as “ladies cut”(White and Dahl 2006), and in product domains perceived to communicate identity, consumers diverged from out-group members’ choices more generally (Berger and Heath 2007).

Illuminating these deep determinants of value shaping the endowment effect and related phenomena can inform novel predictions, identify the potential scope of observed effects, and reveal the degree to which various market incentives will mitigate or enhance effects (Chen, Lakshminarayanan and Santos 2006).

Emerging evidence for loss aversion in animals suggests that this may be the case (Chen et al. 2006; Marsh and Kacelnik 2002).

For instance, smoothies are positioned as healthy alternatives to milkshakes and salads are suggested as replacements for burgers. While salads and smoothies sound like healthy options, objective nutritional information, such as caloric content and number of fat grams, might indicate that they are not really healthier choices. Yet when we do not have complete access to this information, it is hard to decipher the nutritional difference between a healthy option and its unhealthy counterpart. Instead, we may rely on cues to infer an item’s nutritional value. Under certain conditions, however, using cues to infer the healthiness of food items may lead to increased consumption of unhealthy foods. For example, recent research demonstrated that when a fastfood restaurant claims to serve healthy food (eg, Subway), consumers are more likely to underestimate the caloric content of main dishes and to choose higher-calorie side dishes, drinks, or desserts compared to when no such claims are made (eg, McDonald’s; Chandon and Wansink 2007).

For instance, a dieter passing through the candy aisle in a supermarket will be thinking about both the short-term satisfaction from consuming a candy and long-term happiness that comes from a healthy diet. Since the indulgence and dieting goals contradict each other, when it comes to making a decision whether to indulge or not, consumers face goal conflict in such a situation. Consumers, especially those who are high in self-control, may respond to such goal conflicts by employing counteractive self-control strategies (Trope and Fishbach 2000). For example, they may distance themselves from temptations by forming abstract representations of temptations, which reduces the attractiveness of the temptations and helps consumers to act in accordance with their self-regulatory goals (Fujita et al. 2006; Metcalfe and Mischel 1999). Similarly, individuals who have active self-regulatory goals (eg, dieters) may construe an upcoming indulgence as more damaging to said self-regulatory goals (eg, estimating that a sugary soda is high in caloric content) in order to ensure that they can resist the temptation (Zhang et al. 2010).</div><div class="gsh_csp">Importantly, rather than constantly solving self-control conflicts in favor of the restraint or indulgence goal, consumers tend to pursue some degree of balancing among these goals (Fishbach and Dhar 2005; Laran 2010; Laran and Janiszewski 2009; Mukhopadhyay et al. 2008). For example, after eating many chocolate truffles (a relatively unhealthy food), people are more likely to choose a granola bar (a relatively …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'FRANK MAY and CAGLAR IRMAK', 'eprint': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Caglar_Irmak/publication/271799236_Licensing_Indulgence_in_the_Present_by_Distorting_Memories_of_Past_Behavior/links/57a3449f08ae28c095430bab/Licensing-Indulgence-in-the-Present-by-Distorting-Memories-of-Past-Behavior', 'title': 'Conceptual Background', 'url': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Caglar_Irmak/publication/271799236_Licensing_Indulgence_in_the_Present_by_Distorting_Memories_of_Past_Behavior/links/57a3449f08ae28c095430bab/Licensing-Indulgence-in-the-Present-by-Distorting-Memories-of-Past-Behavior'}, 'id_citations': '34ZxWyAAAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr">Page 1.
