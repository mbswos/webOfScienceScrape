Diversified firms have been regarded as destructive of firm value, prone to agency problems and divisional rent-seeking. The empirical finding that multi-division firms tend to trade at a\'discount,\'or negative\'excess value\'relative to their single-segment counterparts, is claimed in support of this view. Our paper offers a different, more positive, perspective. We develop a simple, industry-based model to argue that conglomeration (and discounts) may, in fact, reflect an endogenous, value-enhancing response of firms to industry conditions and agency problems prevalent in all firms, not just conglomerates. With managers reluctant to reduce assets under their control, conglomeration emerges as a way to optimally induce managers to shift resources away from an industry, in response to unfavorable conditions. The model also provides a framework, with testable implications, to analyze patterns of conglomeration and excess values across different environments. The degree of conglomeration in an industry is predicted to have an inverse relation to the excess values of conglomerates in the industry and to the investment opportunities anticipated for single-segment firms. Using a panel data set of fifty of the largest US industries, over 1978-1997, we find significant empirical support for the model\'s predictions.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Timothy R Burch and Vikram K Nanda and MP Narayanan', 'eprint': 'https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/35445/b2034694.0001.001.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y', 'journal': 'Available at SSRN 231529', 'title': "Industry structure and the conglomerate'discount': theory and evidence", 'url': 'https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=231529', 'year': 2000}, 'citedby': 30, 'id_citations': 'GRPzgDIAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '8676183344907372238', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Recent literature has been largely negative in its assessment of value effects of corporate diversification.

We argue that existing value maximization theories of conglomeration predict a negative relation between two industry factors (growth opportunities and industry concentration) and the degree of conglomeration in an industry. We find empirical support for this prediction using a panel of 50 industries across 20 years. The role of value-maximization in conglomeration decisions is further supported by the evidence that conglomerates are more valuable relative to single segment firms when industry conditions predict high levels of conglomeration.

The value-maximization theory models the decision of the target and a chosen acquirer to utilize a lockup option when they anticipate the possibility that a higher-valuing, third-party bidder may appear.

One is the debt-financed accumulation of large quantities of mortgage pass-through securities by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two mortgage-oriented government-sponsored entities who also act as guarantors that the primary mortgage market servicer will deliver the payments received from the mortgage borrower. The second is the increased propensity of mortgage borrowers to prepay and refinance the underlying mortgage loans as soon as primary market rates fall sufficiently below existing loan rates. The prepayment phenomenon asymmetrically increases the interest risk faced by the ultimate lender because although fixed rate funding costs do not drop when the asset’s return does, variable rate funding costs rise with market rates while loan rates are fixed.</div><div class="gsh_csp">While both of these phenomena have received a great deal of academic and industry attention, one area that has not been studied is the impact of refinancing waves on the borrowing costs of the mortgage GSEs.

Nine-eleven provides a particularly useful (albeit tragic) setting for examining investor reaction because of its exogenous, highly visible, and clearly economically significant nature. In addition, unlike other event studies that attempt to achieve comparability in observations by aligning them in time and using data screens, our setting naturally ensures the comparability of the observations. By using net asset value (NAV) returns as benchmarks for price returns, we avoid the need to specify an asset pricing model. We find that cumulative price returns depart significantly from cumulative NAV returns. The overall return pattern is consistent with overreaction and panicked selling in the first trading week after nine-eleven, followed by a reversal over the subsequent two …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Timothy R Burch and Douglas R Emery and Michael E Fuerst', 'title': 'Do Investors Overreact?

The GSEs, which are also referred to as Federal Credit Agencies were major participants in national debt markets during the 1994-2004 decade. Using a comparative sample of debt placements offered by non-GSE financial firms that are also frequent issuers, we document several differences in the characteristics of the underlying securities, many of which can be attributed to the types of assets the GSEs are required to hold given their various federal mandates. Despite these differences, strong similarities exist in the time-series and crosssectional behavior of residual yield spreads on GSE and non-GSE debt (ie, the portions of yields that cannot be explained by obvious issue and macroeconomic factors). These results suggest that the same underlying risk factors …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Timothy R Burch and Andrea J Heuson', 'title': 'Do Yields on Government Sponsored Enterprise (GSE) Issues Include Risk Premia?
