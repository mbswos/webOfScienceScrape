We discuss unique traits that characterize the international expansion of EM MNEs, and the unique motivations that steer them toward internationalization.

We have previously described an alternative mechanism of XIAP inhibition of apoptosis that depends on the selective activation of JNK1. Here we report that two other members of the IAP family, NAIP and ML-IAP, both activate JNK1. Expression of catalytically inactive JNK1 blocks NAIP and ML-IAP protection against ICE- and TNF-α-induced apoptosis, indicating that JNK1 activation is necessary for the antiapoptotic effect of these proteins.

The analysis, based on a recent survey of FIEs in China, demonstrates that time‐based experience has a significantly positive effect on overall and individual dimensions of performance of FIEs. The underlying link between time‐based experience and multidimensional performance is, however, moderated by the cultural distance between the host and home countries.

One often seen bad weather is rain which causes significant yet complex local intensity fluctuations in images. The paper aims at developing an effective algorithm to remove visual effects of rain from a single rainy image, ie separate the rain layer and the de-rained image layer from an rainy image. Built upon a non-linear generative model of rainy image, namely screen blend mode, we proposed a dictionary learning based algorithm for single image de-raining. The basic idea is to sparsely approximate the patches of two layers by very high discriminative codes over a learned dictionary with strong mutual exclusivity property. Such discriminative sparse codes lead to accurate separation of two layers from their non-linear composite. The experiments showed that the proposed method outperformed the existing single image de-raining methods on tested rain images.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Yu Luo and Yong Xu and Hui Ji', 'eprint': 'https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_iccv_2015/papers/Luo_Removing_Rain_From_ICCV_2015_paper.pdf', 'pages': '3397-3405', 'title': 'Removing rain from a single image via discriminative sparse coding', 'url': 'https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_iccv_2015/html/Luo_Removing_Rain_From_ICCV_2015_paper.html', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 118, 'id_citations': 'u0irawQAAAAJ:sFh2DmJudxsC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '9023302150417163363', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div><div><div class="gsh_csp">Inorganic/polymer nanocomposites are significant materials due to their unique combination of properties.

In <i>Drosophila</i> ovaries, the nuclear Piwi protein is required for transcriptional silencing of transposons, though the precise mechanisms by which this occurs are unknown. Here we show that the CG9754 protein is a component of Piwi complexes that functions downstream of Piwi and its binding partner, Asterix, in transcriptional silencing. Enforced tethering of CG9754 to nascent messenger RNA transcripts causes cotranscriptional silencing of the source locus and the deposition of repressive chromatin marks. We have named CG9754 “Panoramix,” and we propose that this protein could act as an adaptor, scaffolding interactions between the piRNA pathway and the general silencing machinery that it recruits to enforce transcriptional repression.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Yang Yu and Jiaqi Gu and Ying Jin and Yicheng Luo and Jonathan B Preall and Jinbiao Ma and Benjamin Czech and Gregory J Hannon', 'eprint': 'http://science.sciencemag.org/content/350/6258/339.full', 'journal': 'Science', 'number': '6258', 'pages': '339-342', 'publisher': 'American Association for the Advancement of Science', 'title': 'Panoramix enforces piRNA-dependent cotranscriptional silencing', 'url': 'http://science.sciencemag.org/content/350/6258/339.short', 'volume': '350', 'year': 2015}, 'citedby': 82, 'id_citations': 'u0irawQAAAAJ:_UIRw3K-QSMC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '8980166982674959177', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div><div><div class="gsh_csp">Facial expressions recognition is an important part of the study in man-machine interface.

But the grayscale global features are environmentally sensitive. So a hybrid method of principal component analysis and local binary pattern (LBP) is introduced in this article. LBP extracts the local grayscale features of the mouth region, which contribute most to facial expression recognition, to assist the global grayscale features of facial expression recognition. The support vector machine (SVM) is used for facial expression recognition.

We applied the information-processing lens in global BPO and developed the logic that internationally disaggregated process integration requires a fit between process integration and BPO\'s task characteristics (i.e., task complexity and security) and task interdependence (task connectivity, stickiness, and dependency). This alignment is further moderated by the task context, such as the geographic dispersion of the global client\'s end-customers and the type of offshore provider (independent vendor vs captive and joint venture).

However, the safety issues and the low efficiency associated with generating human iPSCs have limited their usage in clinical settings. The cell type used to create iPSCs can significantly influence the reprogramming efficiency and kinetics. Here, we show that amniotic fluid cells from the prenatal diagnosis of a β-thalassemia patient can be efficiently reprogrammed using a doxycycline (DOX)-inducible humanized version of the single lentiviral “stem cell cassette” vector flanked by loxP sites, which can be excised with Cre recombinase. We also demonstrated that the patient-derived iPSCs can be characterized based on the expression of pluripotency markers, and they can be differentiated into various somatic cell types in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, microarray analysis demonstrates a high correlation coefficient between human β-thalassemia iPS cells and human embryonic stem (hES) cells but a low correlation coefficient between human β-thalassemia amniotic fluid cells and human β-thalassemia iPS cells. Our data suggest that amniotic fluid cells may be an ideal human somatic cell resource for rapid and efficient generation of patient-specific iPS cells.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Yong Fan and Yumei Luo and Xinjie Chen and Qing Li and Xiaofang Sun', 'eprint': 'https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jrd/58/4/58_2011-046/_pdf', 'journal': 'Journal of Reproduction and Development', 'number': '4', 'pages': '404-409', 'publisher': 'THE SOCIETY FOR REPRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT', 'title': 'Generation of human β-thalassemia induced pluripotent stem cells from amniotic fluid cells using a single excisable lentiviral stem cell cassette', 'url': 'https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jrd/58/4/58_2011-046/_article/-char/ja/', 'volume': '58', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 52, 'id_citations': 'u0irawQAAAAJ:8LfMcXwVQboC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '2426780207782176287', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"> <div class="gsh_csp">The conductivity mechanism for a carbon black (CB) filled high‐density polyethylene (HDPE) compound was investigated in this work. From the experimental results obtained, it can be seen that the relation between electrical current density (<i>J</i>) and applied voltage across the sample (<i>V</i>) coincides with Simmons\'s equation (i.e., the electrical resistivity of the compound decreases with the applied voltage, especially at the critical voltage). The minimum electrical resistivity occurs near the glass transition temperature (<i>T</i><sub><i>g</i></sub>) of HDPE (198 K). It can be concluded that electron tunneling is an important mechanism and a dominant transport process in the HDPE/CB composite.

Length of negotiations and government involvement in negotiations have no main effect on performance but moderate the link between term specificity or topic inclusiveness and performance. When length of negotiations is longer or if government involvement is weaker, the performance effect of negotiations becomes stronger.

In <i>Drosophila</i> the RDC complex, composed of Rhino, Deadlock and Cutoff (Cuff) bind chromatin of dual-strand piRNA clusters, special genomic regions, which encode piRNA precursors. The RDC complex is required for transcription of piRNA precursors, though the mechanism by which it licenses transcription remained unknown. Here, we show that Cuff prevents premature termination of RNA polymerase II.

All alliances, especially equity-based joint ventures, inevitably involve some degree of opportunistic behavior by individual parties or fiduciary risks of interdependence between parties (Das &amp; Teng, 1998; Parkhe, 1993). Any alliance is a loosely coupled system in which investing parties interdependently share existing resources or jointly develop new resources while maintaining their respective parental identities and resource control. This looseness, together with inherent interparty differences in strategic objective, corporate culture, and managerial style plus interparty asymmetry in bargaining power, alliance importance, and parent control, explains why opportunism, or “selfinterest seeking with guile”(Williamson, 1979), occurs. Cross-cultural conflicts and environmental uncertainty in a drastically changing environment further increase the likelihood of opportunism (Lyles, Saxton, &amp; Watson, 2004). As a significant obstacle to fostering cooperation, opportunism impairs collaborative effects and synergy creation, hampers interparty confidence, commitment, and reciprocity, impedes alliance evolution and growth by increasing uncertainty, and eventually increases the …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Yadong Luo', 'journal': 'Handbook of strategic alliances', 'pages': '55-79', 'publisher': 'Sage', 'title': 'Opportunism in Cooperative Alliances', 'url': 'http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=TWg5DQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA55&dq=info:_VRPJhsZ-g0J:scholar.google.com&ots=kRvtSx9P4P&sig=U24BH8tYQUgRisHJjCKaJ-sKKNk', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 33, 'id_citations': 'u0irawQAAAAJ:oFn-K-OQSCAC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '1007145071068271869', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">A myriad of stimuli including proinflammatory cytokines, viruses, and chemical and mechanical insults activate a kinase complex composed of IκB kinase β (IKK-β), IKK-α, and IKK-γ/N, leading to changes in NF-κB-dependent gene expression.

This “large p, small n” paradigm in the area of biomedical “big data” may be at least partly solved by feature selection algorithms, which select only features significantly associated with phenotypes. Feature selection is an NP-hard problem. Due to the exponentially increased time requirement for finding the globally optimal solution, all the existing feature selection algorithms employ heuristic rules to find locally optimal solutions, and their solutions achieve different performances on different datasets. This work describes a feature selection algorithm based on a recently published correlation measurement, Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC). The proposed algorithm, McTwo, aims to select features associated with phenotypes, independently of each other, and achieving high classification performance of the nearest neighbor algorithm. Based on the comparative study of 17 datasets, McTwo performs about as well as or better than existing algorithms, with significantly reduced numbers of selected features. The features selected by McTwo also appear to have particular biomedical relevance to the phenotypes from the literature. McTwo selects a feature subset with very good classification performance, as well as a small feature number. So McTwo may represent a complementary feature selection algorithm for the high-dimensional biomedical datasets.</div></div>', 'author': 'Ruiquan Ge and Manli Zhou and Youxi Luo and Qinghan Meng and Guoqin Mai and Dongli Ma and Guoqing Wang and Fengfeng Zhou', 'eprint': 'https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-016-0990-0', 'journal': 'BMC bioinformatics', 'number': '1', 'pages': '142', 'publisher': 'BioMed Central', 'title': 'McTwo: a two-step feature selection algorithm based on maximal information coefficient', 'url': 'https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-016-0990-0', 'volume': '17', 'year': 2016}, 'citedby': 31, 'id_citations': 'u0irawQAAAAJ:yyP9NS4UN-AC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '969410939288992159', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'author': 'Mike W Peng and Yadong Luo and Li Sun', 'publisher': 'Fisher College of Business, Ohio State University', 'title': 'Firm growth via mergers and acquisitions in China', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=113400886743574569&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 30, 'id_citations': 'u0irawQAAAAJ:HoB7MX3m0LUC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '113400886743574569', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div><div><div class="gsh_csp">This research investigates how distributive justice (DJ) affects cooperation-related outcomes in international joint ventures (IJVs) through several routes that intersect with reciprocal commitment, organizational attachment and contractual specification.

Here, we describe a modified culture medium containing human recombinant leukemia inhibitory factor and human basic fibroblast growth factor that significantly increases the number of human blastocysts formed and their quality, as well as the efficiency of HESC derivation from poor-quality embryos. Culturing poor-quality embryos in modified medium resulted in a two-fold increase in the blastocyst formation rate and a seven-fold increase over the derivation efficiency in conventional medium. We derived 15 HESC lines from poor-quality embryos cultured in modified culture medium and two HESC lines from quality embryos cultured in conventional culture medium. All cell lines shared typical human pluripotent stem cell features including similar morphology, normal karyotypes, expression of alkaline phosphatase, pluripotency genes, such as Oct4, and cell surface markers (SSEA-4, TRA-1-60, TRA-1-81), the ability to form teratomas in SCID mice, and the ability to differentiate into cells of three embryonic germ layers in vitro.

However, the intraoperative monitoring of the visual evoked potential (VEP) is not yet widely used. We evaluate here the clinical utility of intraoperative VEP monitoring.   Methods We analyzed retrospectively 46 consecutive surgeries in 2011-2013. High luminance stimulating devices delivered flash stimuli on the closed eyelid during intravenous anesthesia. We monitored VEP features N75 and P100 and took patients\' preoperative and postoperative visual function from patient charts. Postoperative ophthalmologic workup was performed in 25 (54%) patients and preoperatively in 28 (61%) patients.   Results VEP recordings were feasible in 62 of 85 eyes (73%) in 46 patients. All 23 eyes without VEP had impaired vision. During surgery, VEPs remained stable throughout surgery in 50 eyes. In 44 of these, visual function did not deteriorate and three patients (6 eyes) developed hemianopia. VEP decreased transiently in 10 eyes and visual function of all was preserved. VEPs were lost permanently in 2 eyes in two patients without new postoperative visual impairment.   Conclusions Satisfactory intraoperative VEP monitoring was feasible in all patients except in those with severe visual impairment. Preservation of VEPs predicted preserved visual function.

To understand the underlying anti-metastatic mechanism, we investigated if EBP1 regulates invasion-related molecules. We performed immunohistochemical analysis on 132 primary adenoid cystic carcinoma and adjacent non-cancerous tissues using commercial EBP1, MMP9, E-cadherin and ICAM-1 antibodies. Results were correlated to clinicopathological parameters, long-term survival and invasion-related molecules by statistical analysis. Cell motility and invasiveness of vector or wild-type EBP1-transfected ACC-M cell lines were evaluated using wound healing and Boyden chamber assays. MMP9, E-cadherin and ICAM-1 proteins in these cell lines were detected using western blot assay. The expression of EBP1 was significantly higher in non-cancerous adjacent tissues compared with corresponding cancer tissues. The intensity and percentage of cells that reacted with EBP1 antibodies were significantly higher in cases with tubular pattern than those with solid pattern (P&lt;0.0001).

The study used elasto-plastic analysis of a circular chamber under non-axisymmetrical loads. The results showed that the unloading of in-situ stresses, and the forming of a secondary stress field, leads to a severe change in the stress field around the guide holes. This causes the formation of an X-shaped area of plastic deformation, which prevents the rockburst.

Methods Medical data for 282 patients with surgically treated endometrial cancer were reviewed retrospectively. Preoperative concentrations of six serum biomarkers (CA125, CA15-3, C-reactive protein [CRP], D-dimer [D-D], platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio [PLR], and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio [NLR]) were analysed to determine potential associations with clinicopathologic characteristics and to assess prognostic values separately via Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate Cox regression.   Results In univariate analyses, the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 86.5% for a maximum follow-up period of 75 months. High concentrations of CA125, CA15-3, CRP, D-D, PLR, and NLR each proved significantly predictive of poor survival (log-rank test, P&lt;0.01). CRP and D-D were identified as independent prognosticators, using a Cox regression model. Study patients were then stratified (based on combined independent risk factors) into three tiers (P&lt;0.001), marked by 5-year OS rates of 92.1%, 78.4%, and 33.3%.   Conclusions All serum biomarkers assessed (CA125, CA15-3, CRP, D-D, PLR, and NLR) proved to be valid prognostic indices of surgically treated endometrial cancer. A novel prognostic grouping system, incorporating independent risk factors (CRP and D-D Concentrations), may have merit in assessing these patients preoperatively, providing a biologic basis for improved clinical staging.</div></div>', 'author': 'Jianpei Li and Jianhua Lin and Yaoling Luo and Miaohuan Kuang and Yijun Liu', 'eprint': 'https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0130640', 'journal': 'PloS one', 'number': '6', 'pages': 'e0130640', 'publisher': 'Public Library of Science', 'title': 'Multivariate analysis of prognostic biomarkers in surgically treated endometrial cancer', 'url': 'https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0130640', 'volume': '10', 'year': 2015}, 'citedby': 19, 'id_citations': 'u0irawQAAAAJ:evIcR_-jKtEC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '9993862832343373867', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">A multicast service processing method and access equipment are disclosed.

However, directly replacing the conventional non-EH transmitters by EH nodes will be a challenge. In this paper, we propose to deploy extra EH nodes as relays over an existing non-EH network. Specifically, the considered non-EH network consists of multiple source-destination (S-D) pairs. The deployed EH relays will take turns to assist each S-D pair, and energy diversity can be achieved to combat the low-EH rate of each EH relay. To make the best of these EH relays, with the source transmit power minimization as the design objective, we formulate a joint power assignment and relay selection problem, which, however, is NP-hard.

These isolates were then characterized according to their tolerance to Dim, sensitivity to osmotic stress, and phenotypic properties. All the selected Dim-resistant isolates showed a higher osmosensitivity than the parental strains, and the last generation was more resistant than the first generation in the M, R, and W series. In addition, the changes in the Dim resistance and osmotic sensitivity were not found to be directly correlated, and no distinct morphologic characteristics were found among the resistant and sensitive isolates, with the exception of the resistant isolate K-11. Thus, to investigate the molecular basis of the fungicide resistance, a group III two-component histidine kinase (HK) gene, AlHK1, was cloned from nineteen A. longipes isolates. AlHK1p was found to be comprised of a six 92-amino-acid repeat domain (AARD), HK domain, and response regulator domain, similar to the Os-1p from Neurospora crassa. A comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the AlHK1 gene from the Dim-sensitive and-resistant isolates revealed that all the resistant isolates contained a single-point mutation in the AARD of AlHK1p, with the exception of isolate K-11, where the AlHK1p contained a deletion of 107 amino acids. Moreover, the AlHK1p mutations in the isolates of each respective series involved the same amino acid substitution at the same site, although the resistance levels differed significantly in each series.

However, the tumor-tropic capacity of hiPSC-derived NSCs (hiPS-NSCs) still has much room to improve. Here we attempted to promote the tumor tropism of hiPS-NSCs by manipulating the activity of endogenous miR-199a/214 cluster that is involved in regulation of hypoxia-stimulated cell migration. We first developed a baculovirus-delivered CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) system that sterically blocked the E-box element in the promoter of the miR-199a/214 cluster with an RNA-guided catalytically dead Cas9 (dCas9). We then applied this CRISPRi system to hiPS-NSCs and successfully suppressed the expression of miR-199a-5p, miR-199a-3p, and miR-214 in the microRNA gene cluster. Meanwhile, the expression levels of their targets related to regulation of hypoxia-stimulated cell migration, such as HIF1A, MET, and MAPK1, were upregulated. Further migration assays demonstrated that the targeted inhibition of the miR-199a/214 cluster significantly enhanced the tumor tropism of hiPS-NSCs both in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest a novel application of CRISPRi in NSC-based tumor-targeted gene therapy.</div></div>', 'author': 'Yumei Luo and Xuehu Xu and Xiuli An and Xiaofang Sun and Shu Wang and Detu Zhu', 'eprint': 'http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/sci/2016/3598542.pdf', 'journal': 'Stem Cells International', 'publisher': 'Hindawi', 'title': 'Targeted inhibition of the miR-199a/214 cluster by CRISPR interference augments the tumor tropism of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural stem cells under hypoxic …', 'url': 'https://www.hindawi.com/journals/sci/2016/3598542/abs/', 'volume': '2016', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 12, 'id_citations': 'u0irawQAAAAJ:DejRBzv9GVYC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '2330211935224813843', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"> <div class="gsh_csp">Activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis has been observed in many tumors.

Then LDP operator is used to extract local texture features of eyes and mouth area. After combining the global features with local texture features, the fusion features are obtained. Finally, support vector machine (SVM) is applied to classify and recognize facial expression.

In the view that coexpression of another antitumoral gene with VSV-G can augment the bystander effect, a synthetic regulatory system that triggers transgene expression in a cell fusion-inducible manner has been proposed. Here we have developed a double-switch cell fusion-inducible transgene expression system (DoFIT) to drive transgene expression upon VSV-G-mediated NSC-glioma cell fusion. In this binary system, transgene expression is coregulated by a glioma-specific promoter and targeting sequences of a microRNA (miR) that is highly expressed in NSCs but lowly expressed in glioma cells. Thus, transgene expression is “switched off” by the miR in NSC vectors, but after cell fusion with glioma cells, the miR is diluted and loses its suppressive effect. Meanwhile, in the syncytia, transgene expression is “switched on” by the glioma-specific promoter. Our in vitro and in vivo experimental data show that DoFIT successfully abolishes luciferase reporter gene expression in NSC vectors but activates it specifically after VSV-G-mediated NSC-glioma cell fusion.</div></div>', 'author': 'Yumei Luo and Detu Zhu and Dang Hoang Lam and Juan Huang and Yi Tang and Xitu Luo and Shu Wang', 'eprint': 'https://www.hindawi.com/journals/sci/aa/649080/abs/', 'journal': 'Stem Cells International', 'publisher': 'Hindawi', 'title': 'A double-switch cell fusion-inducible transgene expression system for neural stem cell-based antiglioma gene therapy', 'url': 'https://www.hindawi.com/journals/sci/aa/649080/abs/', 'volume': '2015', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 11, 'id_citations': 'u0irawQAAAAJ:y2egTTA-ddEC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '11472140876174398252', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Evergreen plants are an important component of many ecosystems of the world and occur in numerous evolutionary lineages. In this article we review phenotypic traits of evergreen woody angiosperms occurring in habitats that regularly experience frost. Leaf anatomical traits such as sclerenchymatic tissues or prominent cuticles ensure mechanical strength while often enhancing tolerance of water deficit. The low ratio of photosynthetic to nonphotosynthetic tissues as well as modified cell wall structure and nitrogen allocation patterns in evergreen leaves result in lower mass-based photosynthetic rate and photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency in comparison with deciduous leaves. Their photosynthetic apparatus is adapted for the survival of frost in a down-regulated state with potential for photosynthetic activity in winter during periods of permissive temperatures. Leaf structure interacts with the mechanisms of frost survival. Stem xylem in evergreen plants tends to contain smaller diameter conduits incurring greater resistance to freeze/thaw induced cavitation than in deciduous plants, although at the cost of reduced hydraulic efficiency. In contrast, no such differences in hydraulic conductivity have been documented at the leaf level. There is evidence for reduced structural plasticity of evergreen leaves in response to variability in irradiance, however photosynthetic downregulation occurs in mature leaves in response to self shading. Some evergreen species exhibit slow leaf development and “delayed greening”, while in many species aging is also a very protracted process.

The simulation and experimental results indicate that the algorithm can be adaptive to the channel state\'s change by updating routing table dynamically, effectively improve the accuracy of relay and the success rate, and improve the search efficiency.</div></div>', 'author': 'Wenbing Lu and Yingli Luo and Xiaowei Bi and Yonghong Ma and Yongquan Chen', 'pages': '81-85', 'publisher': 'IEEE', 'title': 'Study on automatic relaying algorithm for PLC based on channel state', 'url': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5588771/', 'volume': '1', 'year': 2010}, 'citedby': 8, 'id_citations': 'u0irawQAAAAJ:jOyC0gq838wC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '3736818468875491491', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">以 300 MW 汽轮发电机为实例, 以有限元方法为工具, 研究大型汽轮发电机在临界失稳条件下磁路饱和与磁场畸变共同作用的本质特点及其对运行的影响. 通过对比分析不同饱和程度和不同功角下的磁场分布, 磁密波形及感应电势等, 发现两者共同作用不仅会导致产生相同气隙电势所需的合成磁势发生变化, 而且还会引起磁密波形对称性及其谐波含量的显著变化; 进一步研究了这些变化对给定负载下的励磁电流, 气隙磁场方向, 电势波形和定子铁心齿部磁密波形的影响. 上述结果为进一步研究发电机在非正常运行条件下的模型和参数提供重要参考.</div></div></div>', 'author': '康锦萍， 刘晓芳， 罗应立， 胡笳', 'journal': '中国电机工程学报', 'number': '36', 'pages': '41-45', 'title': '汽轮发电机磁路饱和与磁场畸变共同作用对运行的影响', 'url': 'http://www.cnki.com.cn/Article/CJFDTotal-ZGDC201036007.htm', 'volume': '30', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 8, 'id_citations': 'u0irawQAAAAJ:OBSaB-F7qqsC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '15284324393249213051', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Implementing multicast connection admission control is provided, and includes: calculating a currently remaining multicast support capability of a network-side functional unit upon receiving a program request initiated from a user; and admitting an access of the user when a support capability required for a program as requested by the user is below or equal to the currently remaining multicast support capability of the network-side functional unit.</div></div></div>', 'eprint': 'https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/6b/18/61/9e5845f95606e1/US20080285559A1.pdf', 'title': 'Method, Device And System For Implementing Multicast Connection Admission Control', 'url': 'https://patents.google.com/patent/US20080285559A1/en', 'year': 2008}, 'citedby': 8, 'id_citations': 'u0irawQAAAAJ:hWqix75wD0QC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '9036514453542209939', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Epidemiological data have implicated perturbations in the regulation of NF-κB activity to diseases that affect a large number of Americans today.

However, there is a lot of ambiguities between smooth image regions and image discontinuities when only degraded images are available. This paper aims at developing new wavelet frame based image regularization to resolve such ambiguities by exploiting geometrical regularities of image discontinuities.

Thus, efficient genetic engineering tools for yeasts are of great research and economic values. Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (AMT) can transfer T-DNA into yeast cells as a method for genetic engineering. However, how the T-DNA is transferred into the yeast cells is not well established yet. Here our genetic screening of yeast knockout mutants identified a yeast actin-related protein ARP6 as a negative regulator of AMT. ARP6 is a critical member of the SWR1 chromatin remodeling complex (SWR-C); knocking out some other components of the complex also increased the transformation efficiency, suggesting that ARP6 might regulate AMT via SWR-C. Moreover, knockout of ARP6 led to disruption of microtubule integrity, higher uptake and degradation of virulence proteins, and increased DNA stability inside the cells, all of which resulted in enhanced transformation efficiency. Our findings have identified molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating AMT and a potential target for enhancing the transformation efficiency in yeast cells.</div></div>', 'author': 'Yumei Luo and Zikai Chen and Detu Zhu and Haitao Tu and Shen Quan Pan', 'eprint': 'https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2015/275092/', 'journal': 'BioMed research international', 'publisher': 'Hindawi', 'title': 'Yeast actin-related protein ARP6 negatively regulates Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of yeast cell', 'url': 'https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2015/275092/abs/', 'volume': '2015', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 7, 'id_citations': 'u0irawQAAAAJ:bF3sBmdg0HEC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '11710987164390790127', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">A method includes receiving multicast traffic intended for host devices; identifying a flow associated with the multicast traffic; retrieving information associated with a group of multicast trees, where the group of multicast trees includes information associated with a group of I/O units, associated with a network node; identifying a particular tree that corresponds to the identified flow, where the particular tree includes information associated with a set of I/O units; and transferring the multicast traffic to an I/O unit, of the set of I/O units, based on the identification of the particular tree, where the transferring enables the I/O unit to send a copy of the multicast traffic to other I/O units of the set of I/O units, and the set of I/O units to process the multicast traffic in a manner that utilizes bandwidth or processing resources in a controlled manner and to send a copy of the multicast traffic to each of the host devices.</div></div></div>', 'eprint': 'https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/f9/4e/08/40362dae346d71/US8699486.pdf', 'title': 'Managing multicast distribution using multicast trees', 'url': 'https://patents.google.com/patent/US8699486B1/en', 'year': 2014}, 'citedby': 7, 'id_citations': 'u0irawQAAAAJ:ax16qXk-rEQC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '13914544819514276748', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Cloud computing, as a new model of service provision in distributed computing environment, faces the great challenge of energy consumption because of its large demand for computing resources.

The algorithm first searches for all feasible scheduling solutions of cloud workflow application with critical path, then the optimal scheduling solution can be found out through calculating total power consumption for each feasible scheduling solution.

The results showed that the inorganic ingredients were mainly calcite and a small amount of lime in the mortar. There was still a small quantity of sticky-rice after such a long period of time. The reason that the lime was not transformed into calcite completely might be ascribed to it being wrapped by the sticky-rice in the mortar. Sticky-rice lime was traditionally used widely as a good natural architectural material in ancient China. The samples from Jiange County were characterized and the results showed that most of the lime had been transformed to calcite and the rest of which might be wrapped by sticky-rice.

These “cheap imported aniline dyes” are widely described as “gaudy”, “garish”, and “strident”, and thought to stand in sharp contrast to more muted “natural” colorants that preceded them. This study calls this narrative into question through an analysis of the colorants of nishiki-e from 1860 until 1900, using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy coupled with micro-Raman, XRF and fiber optic reflectance spectroscopies. The results show that the introduction of synthetic dyes was gradual and selective, and that most of the customary colorants of the late Edo period continued in use. The results revealed a series of key turning points after 1860: (1) In 1864, the purple dye rosaniline became the first synthetic dye to be used in nishiki-e, at first in combination with Prussian blue for a more bluish color. From 1875, it was usually mixed or replaced with methyl violet for a stronger purple. (2) In early 1869, a dramatic and until recently unrecognized transition took place, from the longstanding use of safflower as the dominant red, to its total replacement by imported cochineal carmine. Carmine remained the primary red for the next two decades, often combined with vermillion. (3) In 1877, eosine appeared as the first synthetic red dye in nishiki-e, used alone for pink, and in mixture with carmine for red. (4) Finally, from 1889, a succession of red naphthol dyes of more striking color appeared.

Building on the organizational ambidexterity theory, we argue that organizations can reconcile their short‐term and long‐term tensions, but this does necessitate managerial endeavours that orchestrate this reconciliation. We introduce the concept of temporal ambidexterity and define four intertemporal tensions involving an organization’s objectives, resources, markets, and uncertainty. We examine how firms can address these tensions successfully in the context of new ventures, and to do so we focus on three managerial capabilities of founder‐CEOs: expertise breadth, external connectivity, and empowering leadership.

Nowadays, many multi-label learning approaches have been proposed, unfortunately, all of the existing multi-label learning approaches did not consider the issue of protecting the sensitive information of private instances.

We argue that strategic asset‐seeking intent, financial abundance, and inward internationalization enable EMNEs to better manage uncertainty and capture benefits, resulting in greater levels of risk‐taking behaviors in foreign entry mode and global dispersion. We offer a process framework showing that the effects of endogenous forces on risk‐taking behaviors take place via a partial mediating role of risk‐taking propensity (entrepreneurial attitude toward risk). Our analysis of Chinese MNEs provides strong evidence validating these arguments.

This growth led to a surge in academic interest in these firms, including special issues and volumes dedicated to their analysis (eg Aulakh, 2007; Cuervo-Cazurra, 2012; Cuervo-Cazurra &amp; Ramamurti, 2014; Gammeltoft, Barnard &amp; Madhok, 2010; Luo &amp; Tung, 2007; Ramamurti &amp; Singh, 2009; Williamson et al., 2013).

A stent-based resonant circuit serves as a frequency selective wireless heater controlled using a tuned radio-frequency (RF) electromagnetic field radiated externally, applying local thermal stress to the stented site to suppress in-stent restenosis. A biocompatible 1.5 × 2 × 0.6-mm <sup>3</sup> chip of micro circuit breaker with an embedded capacitor is developed and integrated with the stent to establish the resonant circuitry with a series-connected micro breaker.

The authors theorize the type of learning–exploitative or exploratory–that would be pursued by each type of firm. The difference occurs not only in the types of learning pursued and in the learning processes, but also depends on the level of maturity of the emerging markets. The propositions offered by the authors can guide future research on organizational learning by firms in China as well as in other emerging markets.

The method works independently of the advection scheme and can be easily combined with other advection schemes to enhance the effect.

We found that the orbital symmetry mismatch between the sections with sp 2 and sp 3 edges is responsible for the totally suppressed conductivity of the edge states, and the gap size is determined by the minimal energy difference between the second highest valence band and the second lowest conduction band of the corresponding sp 2-edged ribbons.

The developed software is capable of calculating the theoretical bridge rating factors based on AASHTO Load and Resistance Factor Rating specifications, and automatically produces the field adjustment factor through load testing data. The sensing system along with its application in bridge deck rating was successfully demonstrated on the Evansville Bridge in West Virginia. A finite element model was conducted for the test bridge, and was used to calculate the load distribution factors of the bridge deck after verifying its results using field data. A confirmation field test was conducted on the same bridge and its results varied by only 3% from the first test.

Many contributions consider a total power constraint (TPC) on the sum of transmit power from all nodes in addressing PA problem. However, in practical implementations, each transmit node is equipped with its own power amplifier and is limited by individual power constraint (IPC). Hence these PA methods under TPC are not realizable in practical systems. Meanwhile, the PA problem under IPC is essential, but it has not been studied. This paper extends the traditional non-cooperative water-filling PA algorithm to IPC-based Co-MIMO systems. Moreover, the PA matrix is derived based on the compound channel matrix from all the cooperative nodes to the user.

By means of simulation analysis and combining with field measurement in power network, it is found that there are defects in the traditional demodulation mode that takes the local power grid voltage zero-crossing as the benchmark, that is, except interfereces in power network, the voltages phase difference at the terminals of sender and receiver will lead to deviation in demodulation time domain, therefore the communication performance is degraded, however the voltage phase difference is related to multi factors such as impedance of transmission line, load, connection mode of power transformer and so on, and these factors are imposible to be predetermined.

Methods Eighteen male dogs (12 protocol, 6 sham) were used, with 15 minutes (short-ischemia group, n= 6) or 60 minutes (long-ischemia group, n= 6) of left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion, followed by 120 minutes of reperfusion. The animals were killed after 120 min reperfusion and the heart was quickly removed. The myocardium was examined pathologically by electron microscopy. HSP70 mRNA expression both in healthy and ischemic myocardium was measured by a semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method using complementary DNA normalized against the housekeeping gene of β-actin. Results (1) No ultrastructural changes of microvessels and myocardial cells except a slight loss of mitochondrial granules were noted in reperfusion myocardium from dogs of the short-ischemia group. In the long-ischemia group, endothelial cells of capillaries were slightly swelling, and the intercellular linking gaps of endothelial cells slightly widened. As for myocardial cells, intercellular, intermyofibrillar, and intermyofilamentous edema were present. Besides, the fractures of a few myofilaments, the granule less and swelling of mitochondrias were also seen.(2) HSP70 mRNA expression level in both ischemia-reperfusion zone and intact myocardium in short-ischemia group was markedly higher than that in sham-operation group.

It provides firms with both tremendous opportunities and daunting challenges. International expansion has become a pervasive and prominent strategic response to global economic dynamics for a large array of companies. The need to simultaneously balance the dynamic tension between multiple forces (geographic, product, market, technological) has resulted in firms extending their presence all over the globe for a multitude of purposes and through a multitude of forms. Correspondingly, international expansion decisions and strategies have acquired increasing strategic significance. International expansion is the process by which a multinational enterprise (MNE) enters and invests in a target foreign country in the pursuit of strategic objectives. Firms often expand internationally because of both\'pull\'and\'push\'factors. Firms are\'pulled\'or attracted by the cost-side and/or revenueside benefits derived from host country dynamics. Cost-side benefits are generated from low-cost production factors and operational expenses. Revenue-side benefits result from market demand growth in a foreign country. Although facing liabilities of foreignness, an MNE\'s competitive advantages, manifested in strong technological and organizational skills, may enable the firm to pre-empt emerging investment opportunities and explore market potential. Other revenue-related benefits include accessibility to scarce resources, preferential treatment for foreign direct investment (FDI), and learning or experience accumulation.

In this paper, we present current developments in the field of adaptive radiotherapy (ART), the progression toward KBR-ART, and examine several applications of static and dynamic machine learning approaches for realizing the KBR-ART framework potentials in maximizing tumor control and minimizing side effects with respect to individual radiotherapy patients. Specifically, three questions required for the realization of KBR-ART are addressed:(1) what knowledge is needed;(2) how to estimate RT outcomes accurately; and (3) how to adapt optimally.

Rats were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and the cadavers were placed at 20℃. The FTIR spectrum data of rats\' spleen tissues were taken and measured at different time points. After pretreatment, the data was analysed by data mining method. The absorption peak intensity of rat\'s spleen tissue spectrum changed with the PMI, while the absorption peak position was unchanged. The results of principal component analysis (PCA) showed that the cumulative contribution rate of the first three principal components was 96%. There was an obvious clustering tendency for the spectrum sample at each time point. The methods of partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and support vector machine classification (SVMC) effectively divided the spectrum samples with different PMI into four categories (0-24 h, 48-72 h, 96-120 h and 144-168 h). The determination coefficient (R²) of the PMI estimation model established by PLS regression analysis was 0.96, and the root mean square error of calibration (RMSEC) and root mean square error of cross validation (RMSECV) were 9.90 h and 11.39 h respectively. In prediction set, the R² was 0.97, and the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) was 10.49 h. The FTIR spectrum of the rat\'s spleen tissue can be effectively analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively by the combination of FTIR spectroscopy and data mining method, and the classification and PLS regression models can be …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Lei Wang and XC Qin and HC Lin and KF Deng and YW Luo and QR Sun and QX Du and ZY Wang and Ya Tuo and JH Sun', 'journal': 'Fa yi xue za zhi', 'number': '1', 'pages': '1-6', 'title': 'Establishment of the Mathematical Model for PMI Estimation Using FTIR Spectroscopy and Data Mining Method', 'url': 'https://europepmc.org/abstract/med/29577696', 'volume': '34', 'year': 2018}, 'id_citations': 'u0irawQAAAAJ:aWrUoCkCBaEC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'author': 'Qiran Sun and Yiwen Luo and Qinghua Zhang and Yachen Wang and Xu Yang', 'pages': '150-150', 'publisher': 'ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD', 'title': 'THE DEGRADATION OF BASIC DYES IN BALLPOINT PEN INK ENTRIES IN THREE YEARS', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15531868688767591508&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'volume': '277', 'year': 2017}, 'id_citations': 'u0irawQAAAAJ:8ThBWkzwpf8C', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'author': 'Y Luo and D Mcshan and R Ten Haken and I El Naqa', 'journal': 'Medical Physics', 'number': '6', 'pages': '3158', 'publisher': 'Medical Physics', 'title': 'a Multi-objective Dynamic Bayesian Network Approach for Adaptive Personalized Radiotherapy in Non-small-cell Lung Cancer (nsclc): tu-fg-605-01', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10813972556081935043&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'volume': '44', 'year': 2017}, 'id_citations': 'u0irawQAAAAJ:K1TAGxA9IWwC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'author': 'S Cui and Y Luo and R Ten Haken and I El Naqa', 'journal': 'Medical Physics', 'number': '6', 'pages': '2984', 'publisher': 'Medical Physics', 'title': 'feature Selection and Prediction of Radiation-induced Lung Damage in Radiotherapy of Lung Cancer with Deep Multi-layer Neural Network-based Methods: su-j-campus-jt-02', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9369493702713505665&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'volume': '44', 'year': 2017}, 'id_citations': 'u0irawQAAAAJ:TciIZjdTqZoC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr">交通大學機構典藏致力於蒐集、組織、保存、取用與傳播本校的學術研究產出和各項活動成果，希望\n藉此分享本校的學研成效，期使更有利於與世界各地的學術研究者接軌，從而促進學術傳播。\n</div>', 'author': 'H Tseng and Y Luo and J Chien and R Ten Haken and I El Naqa', 'journal': 'Medical Physics', 'pages': '3078-3078', 'title': 'Deep Reinforcement Learning for Automated Dose Adaptation in Lung Cancer', 'url': 'https://ir.nctu.edu.tw/handle/11536/144616', 'volume': '44', 'year': 2017}, 'id_citations': 'u0irawQAAAAJ:gYAb_yFic6IC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Many scholars rise in academic reviewing structures, moving from ad-hoc reviewers, to editorial board members and then to associate editors or editors of reputable scientific journals.

However, the development of computational cameras has been limited by the lack of a technology that can efficiently support temporal encoding. Conventionally, temporal encoding is performed by complicated off-chip optics such as split light modulators (SLMs). This results in camera systems with large physical sizes, performance degradation, and high power consumption. In this paper, we propose a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) pixel design that performs temporal optical binary encoding for on-chip, high-speed computational imaging applications.

Methods Six healthy Guangxi Bama miniature pigs were selected for this study, and S3, S5 and S6 used as target hepatic segments. The hepatic pedicles were lesioned by radioablation under ultrasound guidance. The hepatic artery was clamped temporarily at the time of radioablation. Three segments (S3, S5 and S6) were resected on each pig. The main outcome measures included the local and general tolerance, the change of blood flow parameters of each segmental arterial and portal branches, and the microscopic appearance of the segmental arterial, portal and biliary tract branches. Results There was no any complication or death following RFA application, and the liver function was restored to normal 14 days after the operation in all animals. Demarcation areas were clear in all target hepatic segments. The blood flow velocity of the portal branches was 0cm/s in all the target hepatic segments after RFA. The arterial blood flow velocity was 15.1±15.4 cm/s, which was significantly lower compared with that before RFA (P&gt; 0.000). There was no difference in the flow rate of the unaffected segmental vessels following RFA. The mean ablated length of segmental portal, arterial and biliary tract branches was 1.7±0.5 cm, 1.4±0.4 cm, 1.6±0.4 cm, respectively. Conclusions The technique is expedient, safe and effective.

In metazoa, TREX is loaded on nascent RNA transcribed by RNA polymerase II in a splicing-dependent fashion; however, how TREX functions is poorly understood. Here we show that Thoc5 and other TREX components are essential for the biogenesis of piRNA, a distinct class of small noncoding RNAs that control expression of transposable elements (TEs) in the Drosophila germline. Mutations in TREX lead to defects in piRNA biogenesis, resulting in derepression of multiple TE families, gametogenesis defects, and sterility. TREX components are enriched on piRNA precursors transcribed from dual-strand piRNA clusters and colocalize in distinct nuclear foci that overlap with sites of piRNA transcription. The localization of TREX in nuclear foci and its loading on piRNA precursor transcripts depend on Cutoff, a protein associated with chromatin of piRNA clusters. Finally, we show that TREX is required for accumulation of nascent piRNA precursors.

This view explains how EMFs creatively adopt a composition-based international strategy, enabling them to compensate for their weaknesses while capitalizing on their strengths during global competition where they offer a competitive price-value ratio suited to a wide range of global customers. We further examine the enhancing forces (i.e., strategic resource-seeking motivation, autonomy delegation, and cross-border sharing system) that fortify the outcome of composition. Using survey data from 227 EMFs from China, our empirical results support these key arguments.

Completely covered VRI band light curves and four times of minimum light were obtained. Combining the photometric and previously published radial-velocity data, a revised photometric analysis was carried out for the binary system by applying the Wilson–Devinney code. With a hot spot placed on the massive primary component near the neck region of the common envelope, the light curves were satisfactorily modeled. The photometric solution combined with the radial-velocity solution reveals that XZ Leo is an A-type contact binary with a degree of contact of 24 (±1)%.

The membership and physical properties are discussed, based on their light curves, positions in the color magnitude diagrams, spatial locations and periods. A known EB-type eclipsing binary is also identified as a blue straggler candidate in the cluster. Furthermore, we find that all eclipsing contact binaries have prominent asymmetric eclipses and display the O\'Connell effect, which increases with a decrease in orbital periods.

The density modeling method eDensity is extended to handle the mixedsize placement. We conduct detailed analysis on the correctness of the gradient formulation and the numerical solution, as well as the rationale of direct-current removal and the advantages over prior density functions. Nesterov’s method is used as the nonlinear solver, which shows high yet stable performance over mixed-size circuits. The steplength as the inverse of Lipschitz constant of the gradient function, while we develop a backtracking method to prevent overestimation. An approximated nonlinear preconditioner is developed to minimize the topological and physical differences between large macros and standard cells. Besides, we devise a simulated annealer to legalize the layout of macros and use a second-phase global placement to reoptimize the standard cell layout. All the above innovations are integrated into our mixed-size placement prototype ePlace-MS, which outperforms all the related works in literature with better quality and efficiency. Compared to the leading-edge mixed-size placer NTUplace3 [13], ePlace-MS produces up to 22.98% and on average 8.22% shorter wirelength over all the sixteen modern mixed-size (MMS) benchmark circuits with the same runtime.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Yiu-Chung Wong Chang and Lu Sha and Dennis Huang and Yufeng Luo and Chin-Chi Teng and Chung-Kuan Cheng', 'eprint': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jingwei_Lu/publication/273348423_PD14_ePlace-MS_Electrostatics_based_Placement_for_Mixed-Size_Circuits/links/5690078d08aee91f69a14494.pdf', 'title': 'ePlace-MS: Electrostatics based Placement for Mixed-Size Circuits', 'url': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jingwei_Lu/publication/273348423_PD14_ePlace-MS_Electrostatics_based_Placement_for_Mixed-Size_Circuits/links/5690078d08aee91f69a14494.pdf', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'u0irawQAAAAJ:i4l3h6Pr8ZgC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr">Close Menu ❌.

It is assumed that each player can update knowledge of the opponent and assess possible future scenarios of the dynamic game based on their previous interactions. Therefore, finding the best current move of the defender is modeled as a discrete-time stochastic control problem. An on-line, convergent, scenario based proactive defense (SPD) algorithm considering adaptive learning is developed based on differential dynamic programming (DDP) to solve the associated optimal control problem. Numerical experiment shows that the new algorithm can help the defender in finding the best dynamic strategies quickly and efficiently.

Typically, an incident radio wave can be detected by measuring the difference of arrival time or phase between spatially spaced sensors of the antenna array. It becomes challenging due to abundant multipath and obstacles in dense cluttered environments, such as enclosed areas, tunnels or under-ground. Ultra-wide band (UWB) radio frequency identification (RFID) system provides a promising solution in these global-positioning-system (GPS-) denied environments due to a number of advantages such as low duty cycle, multipath immunity and low cost. However, the system susceptibility to dense cluttered environments is not well studied, and the potential of UWB signals for direction finding is not well investigated. In this thesis, the performance limits in dense cluttered environments are firstly studied in detail. A channel model of plane waves from far-field reflectors or scatterers superimposed with near-field interferences is proposed, and the Cram´er-Rao bounds for ranging and direction finding are derived to analyze the channel effects. Based on the insights into path-overlapping effects in the first cluster, a joint time-of-arrival (TOA) and angle-of-arrival (AOA) estimator with improved performance is then designed. Secondly, various channel effects, including the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the near-field perturbation level, the far-field reflector spatial spacing and uncertain number of plane waves, on the robustness of UWB RFID system for direction finding are addressed. A robust solution for UWB impulse radio signals employing the alternating …</div></div>', 'author': 'Yanjia Luo', 'title': 'Direction finding for UWB RFID system in dense cluttered environments', 'url': 'https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/handle/10356/61958', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'u0irawQAAAAJ:p2iGfxNeIOAC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Monodisperse poly (methyl methacrylate)(PMMA) microspheres were successfully prepared through emulsifier-free emulsion polymerization with Cu2+ system, using methyl methacrylate (MMA) as the monomers, and potassium persulfate (KPS) as the initiator.

Following the analytical framework of "transactional attributes-governance mechanism-economic efficiency" of Transaction Cost Economics (TCE), this paper discusses the existing literature from three perspectives. The first one is the meaning and measures of contract forms. The second is how the asset specificity, uncertainty and complexity affect the selection of the contract form. The third is whether the contract selection can improve the project performance or save the transaction cost of the project based on TCE.

Method BB7 was artificially agedby xenon light, resulting in the production of five de-ethyl products. A high performance liquid chromatography tandem massspectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed for the analysis of these analytes. Afterwards, ink entries of nine ballpointpens were aged by daylight for three months. Furthermore, the artificial aging of ink samples with xenon light and heat was alsoperformed. Results While the amount of BB7 continuously decreased, its de-ethyl products, E4 and E3, reached their maximumsuccessively; E2, E1, and E0 kept increasing during three months. The aging curves of BB7 and its degraded products underlight exposure in most tested ink entries were best fitted to exponential and quadratic functions, respectively. Conclusion It wasdetermined that the relative amount of BB7 is an exponential function of light energy, and those of E4 and E3 are quadratic ones. The aging process of BB7 is ink formula dependent, and temperature has very limited influence on BB7’s degradation.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Qi-ran SUN and Yi-wen LUO and Ping XIANG and Jian-hua XI and Xu YANG and Che XU', 'journal': 'Chinese Journal of Forensic Sciences', 'number': '1', 'pages': '9', 'title': 'The aging behavior of Basic Blue 7 and its de-ethyl productsin ballpoint pen ink entries by LC-MS/MS', 'url': 'http://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTOTAL-SFJD201301009.htm', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'u0irawQAAAAJ:LkrQC8aPkXYC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">According to the standards, the mis-utilization and mismanagement of food machinery lubricant will have negative impact on food safety.

This effort culminated in four papers submitted to high quality journals and a book and they are partially published. The first paper presents a novel fictitious play approach to describe the interactions between the attackers and network administrator along a dynamic game. Multi-objective optimization methodology is used to predict the attacker\'s best actions at each decision node. The administrator also keeps track of the attacker\'s actions and updates his knowledge on the attacker\'s behavior and objectives after each detected attack, and uses this information to update the prediction of the attacker\'s future actions to find its best response strategies. The second paper proposes a Dynamic game tree based Fictitious Play (DFP) approach to describe the repeated interactive decision processes of the players. Each player considers all possibilities in future interactions with their uncertainties, which are based on learning the opponent\'s decision process (including risk attitude, objectives). Instead of searching the entire game tree, appropriate future time horizons are dynamically selected for both players. The administrator keeps tracking the opponent\'s actions, predicts the probabilities of future possible attacks, and then chooses its best moves. The third paper introduces an optimization model to maximize the deterministic equivalent of the random payoff function of a computer network administrator in defending the system against random attacks.

This line contains photo (thermo)-sensitive genic male sterile (PTGMS) genes in the two-line system hybrid rice and cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) genes in the three-line system hybrid rice, which has a great application potential in hybrid rice breeding for its stable sterility. To understand the underlying genetic mechanism and to explore male sterility of rice, the selected 2310SA line and its maintainer line of the two-line system, PTGMS line 2310S, were grown in Hefei, China. The anthers were collected at four panicle developmental stages (meiosis, mononucleate, binucleate and mature stages) and the isolated RNA were used for microarray analysis. Results showed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at meiosis stage (1938genes up-regulated, 1635genes down-regulated) and mature stage (2220genes up-regulated, 2656genes down-regulated) were more than those at mononucleate stage (752genes up-regulated, 693genes down-regulated) and binucleate stage (1025genes up-regulated, 886 genes down-regulated). The number of down-regulated genes was higher than that of up-regulated genes at mature stage, whereas at other stages the number of up-regulated genes was more than that of down-regulated genes. Moreover, hierarchical cluster analysis of all DEGs suggested that the expression of the DEGs at mononucleate and binucleate stages belonged to the same cluster, and the expression of the DEGs at meiosis and mature stages to another two clusters.

The loading behavior of the bolted joints used in aluminum alloy structures has been widely investigated in many developed countries till now. Some suitable design methods and/or directions are obtained and adopted in current related specifications. Then because of almost rare application in civil engineering, the loading behavior and the design methods of bolted joints of the aluminum alloy structures are not investigated deeply and thoroughly in China. And the collapse mechanism of the joints has not been thoroughly understood yet. No applicable standards or references can be adopted for actual design now.

It has been widely adopted by seismic design codes all over the world, although it is limited to linear systems. The progresses of the method are summarized in this paper. The limitations and the shortcomings of the method are pointed out. In current response spectrum method, the initial stiffness matrix of a structure is adopted in traditional modal analysis, but the effects of the structure deformations on the stiffness matrix are not considered yet. In fact, behavior of long span spatial structures under dynamic loads is higher nonliear and much complex. As an example, an long span arch structure is analyzed for revealing the effects of the  geometrical nonlinearity and comparison in the paper. The numerical results show that there are obvious differences between two groups of vibration modes and corresponding periods obtained from the deformed and the undeformed structure configurations. Therefore, it is theoretically irrational to describe overall dynamic responses of a long span spatial structure by means of linear vibration mode theory. And also only a general damping ratio of a structure is usually employed in the troditional spectrum response analysis, instead of multi-material damping ratios, in almost all seismic design codes. If a structure is composed of different materials or/and installed more than one type of dampers, there are of couse several different damping ratios in the structure. The damping matrix in motion equations is no longer a classical damping matrix. As a result, the free vibration characters …</div></div>', 'author': 'Yongfeng LUO and Lei WANG', 'eprint': 'https://riunet.upv.es/bitstream/handle/10251/6532/PAP_LUO_397.pdf', 'journal': 'Symposium of the International Association for Shell and Spatial Structures (50th. 2009.

For a successful image search system, removing outliers in the top ranked results is a challenging task. Typical content based image search engines take an input image from one class as a query and compute relevance between the query and images in a database. The results often contain a large number of outliers, since these outliers may be similar to the query image in some way. In this thesis we present a novel search scheme using query images from multiple classes. Instead of conducting query search for one image class at a time, we conduct multi-class query search jointly. By using several query classes that are similar to each other for multi-class query, we can utilize information across similar classes to fine tune the similarity measure to remove outliers.

However, corruption in emerging markets is pervasive and rampant. This study addresses how MNE subunits strategically respond to perceived corruption in the business segment of a foreign emerging market wherein they invest and operate. My analysis suggests that an MNE subunit’s investment commitment decreases, and its export market orientation increases, with perceived escalated corruption in the specific business segment. Though perceived corruption in an industrial setting (sectorial corruption) has a stronger effect on the subunit’s market orientation, changes in perceived corruption over time (longitudinal corruption) exert a greater influence on investment commitment. To individual subunits, the strength of these strategic responses to corruption is heightened by their ethical awareness but weakened by their indigenous dependence.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Yadong Luo', 'eprint': 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.936.6857&rep=rep1&type=pdf', 'title': 'Strategic Responses to Perceived Corruption in an Emerging Market', 'url': 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.936.6857&rep=rep1&type=pdf', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'u0irawQAAAAJ:2vOInSJYjVwC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'author': 'Haresh Gurnani and Yadong Luo and Murat Erkoc', 'journal': 'Operations Research Management Science', 'number': '3', 'pages': '269', 'title': 'Ah: 100 Impact of product pricing and timing of investment decisions on supply chain co-opetition', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10581771604767185475&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'volume': '48', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'u0irawQAAAAJ:t6usbXjVLHcC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr">The guest editors wish to acknowledge and thank members of the Editorial Review Board and \nthe scholars listed below who have contributed their time to review manuscripts for this “Qualitative \nResearch in International Business” Special Issue … Adler, Nancy Aguilera, Ruth Ahlstrom, \nDavid Ambos, Björn Ambos, Tina Andersson, Ulf Asakawa, Kazuhiro Au, Kevin … Balogun, \nJulia Bansal, Pratima Baruch, Yehuda Beamish, Paul Belk, Russell Benito, Gabriel Berdrow, \nIris Berry, Heather Beugelsdijk, Sjoerd Bhagat, Rabi Bingham, Chris Bird, Allan Bonardi, \nJean-Philippe Bouquet, Cyril Bruton, Garry Bryant, Teri … Chapman, Malcolm Chen, Shih-Fen \nChetty, Sylvie Collinson, Simon Coviello, Nicole Crick, David Cuervo-Cazurra, Alvaro … \nDanis, Wade Dorfman, Peter Doucet, Lorna Douglas, Susan … Gabrielsson, Peter \nGawande, Kishore Gephart, Robert Ger, Guliz Gluesing, Julia Gray, Sidney Guler, Isin  </div>', 'author': 'Paul Adler and Ruth Aguilera and Christina Ahmidjian and Juan Alcacer and Paul Beamish and Gabriel Benito and Heather Berry and Jean Boddewyn and Nakiye Boyacigiller and Dana Brown and Joseph Clougherty and Regis Coeurderoy and Jean-Claude Cosset and Alvaro Cuervo-Cazurra and Richard Deeg and Andrew Delios and Jonathan Doh and John H Dunning and Carl Fey and Ray Fisman and Peer Fiss and C Fritz Foley and Mauro F Guillén and Guy Holburn and Bryan Husted and Srividya Jandhyala and Geoff Jones and Beata Smarzynska Jovorcik and Steve Kobrin and Tatiana Kostova and Bernard Leca and Don Lessard and Xiaoqu Luo and John Paul MacDuffie and Ike Mathur and Kyle Mayer and Gerald McDermott and Klaus Meyer and Stewart Miller and Glenn Morgan and Ben M Oviatt and Susan Perkins and Laura Poppo and Aseem Prakash and Ravi Ramamurti and Joan-Enric Ricart and Tom Roehl', 'journal': 'Journal of International Business Studies', 'pages': '705', 'title': 'List of Reviewers for this Special Issue', 'url': 'https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm?abstractid=1865636', 'volume': '39', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'u0irawQAAAAJ:BrmTIyaxlBUC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">摘要 多层混合结构房屋承重纵墙计算模式中关于砌体对梁端的约束作用这一问题一直未能得到较好的解决. 针对此问题, 制作了一榀两层单跨混合结构模型, 进行了墙体对梁端约束作用的试验研究, 考察了构件的破坏过程和破坏特征, 分析了梁端约束弯矩和转角, 跨中挠度和弯矩随荷载的变化规律, 并与按现行规范计算结果进行了比较; 同时采用有限元分析软件对梁端约束情况进行了非线性分析, 并将分析结果与试验数据进行了比较, 此外, 探讨了梁端插入墙体长度以及墙体应力等因素对梁端约束的影响. 试验研究和有限元分析结果表明: 多层混合结构房屋梁端存在约束力矩, 并随荷载的增加呈抛物线变化, 反映了框架性质, 多层混合结构房屋不能简单地按铰接简图计算内力, 现有规范计算公式误差也较大; 梁端约束力矩与梁的刚度, 砌体的刚度, 梁端插入墙体的长度, 墙体上部荷载, 梁上荷载, 梁与墙体连接处的节点构造等因素有关.</div></div></div>', 'author': '孙伟民， 周彬彬， 郭樟根， 张大长， 罗宇', 'journal': '建筑结构学报', 'number': '04', 'pages': '90-96', 'title': '墙体对梁端约束的试验研究与有限元分析', 'url': 'http://manu25.magtech.com.cn/Jwk3_jzjgxb/CN/abstract/abstract510.shtml', 'volume': '28', 'year': 2007}, 'id_citations': 'u0irawQAAAAJ:4hFrxpcac9AC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">This chapter extends the existing research on cross-cultural strategic alliances by discussing independent and joint effects of distributive, procedural and interactional justice in this setting.

EM MNEs use international expansion as a springboard to acquire strategic resources and reduce their institutional and market constraints at home. In so doing, they overcome their latecomer disadvantage in the global stage via a series of aggressive, risktaking measures by aggressively acquiring or buying critical assets from mature MNEs to compensate for their competitive weaknesses. We discuss unique traits that characterize the international expansion of EM MNEs, and the unique motivations that steer them toward internationalization. We further delineate peculiar strategies and activities undertaken by these firms in pursuit of international expansion, as well as internal and external forces that might compel or facilitate their propulsion into the global scene.

The MNC consists of diverse and geographically dispersed subunits, which encounter language barriers when communicating with their local business community as well as within their network (Triandis, 1982; Adler, 1983; Herbert, 1984; Ronen and Shenkar, 1985; Hofstede, 2001; Brannen, 2004). As an example, 60% of Citigroup employees worldwide do not speak English, challenging the dissemination of headquarter policy, the communication of local concerns, and value creation across subunit boundaries. Language barriers between the home and host country are part of the liability of foreignness, an impediment to effective negotiations and alliance evolution. Language can also have an impact on conflict management in cross-cultural teams (Von Glinow et at., 2004), headquarters-subsidiary relations (Gupta, 1987), training effectiveness (Tung, 1982), knowledge transfer and …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Yadong Luo and Oded Shenkar', 'journal': 'International business and globalization', 'number': '3', 'pages': '226', 'publisher': 'Sage Publications', 'title': 'The Multinational Corporation', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13667719138528532623&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'volume': '37', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'u0irawQAAAAJ:JoZmwDi-zQgC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">This study attempts to identify variations of social and economic control mechanisms used in buyer-supplier partnerships and explore how such variations are related to behavioral differences.

TNFα initiates the signal that leads to activation of the transcription factor NF-κB, which controls the expression of numerous genes whose products mediate the recruitment and activation of phagocytic cells. A dominantly inherited autoinflammatory syndrome called familial hibernian fever is associated with germline mutations in the extracellular domains of the type I TNFα receptor (TNFRI). In this disorder, the TNFRI is constantly active. IRAK-1 (Interleukin-I Receptor Associated Kinase-1) and SIMPL (Signaling molecule that interacts with pelle-like kinase) are members of a signaling pathway that is required for full activation of TNFα-dependent NF-κB-controlled gene expression.

Data from 295 IJVs in a developing economy (China) show transaction cost analysis to be more applicable to foreign than to Chinese parents. Both overall and specific controls are associated with performance for foreign parents, while only specific control is for Chinese parents. Under goal incongruity, Chinese parent control is associated with foreign parent dissatisfaction with IJV performance, but not vice-versa.

And similar patches satisfy the low-rank property when grouped together. This property has led to many powerful image/video denoising schemes with impressive performance but has never been used for single-image de-raining.

By 2015, emerging market multinational companies (EMNCs) accounted for one-quarter of world outward foreign direct investment (FDI) flows and one-fifth of the largest firms in the Fortune Global 2000. This growth led to a surge in academic interest in these firms, including special issues and volumes dedicated to their analysis (eg Aulakh, 2007; Cuervo-Cazurra, 2012; Cuervo-Cazurra &amp; Ramamurti, 2014; Gammeltoft, Barnard &amp; Madhok, 2010; Luo &amp; Tung, 2007; Ramamurti &amp; Singh, 2009; Williamson et al., 2013).

Part of the debate and associated confusion emerges from the flawed comparison that some of the analyses make, particularly in disentangling the impact of a multinational’s home country from that of other variables.

However, it is not clear whether an early mover strategy or a late mover strategy will result in better performance in these markets characterized by both potential opportunities and tremendous uncertainties and difficulties. This article uses the experience of foreign investors in China to shed light on this question.

Studies on organizational justice analyze perception formation, the cognitive and emotional processing of events, attitudinal and behavioral reactions to perceived mistreatment, and the formation of justice climates within workgroups and organizations (Rupp, 2011). We have accumulated a rich body of literature with deep knowledge on this issue from the last 50 years of research in this area. We know that justice and fairness matter to employees. Multiple meta-analytic investigations have shown employee justice perceptions predict a wide array of organizational-and employee-relevant attitudes behaviors (Colquitt, Scott, Rodell, Long, Zapata, Conlon, &amp; Wesson, 2013; Rupp, Shao, Jones, &amp; Liao, 2014). When employees feel they have been treated fairly, they respond with citizenship, heightened performance, and commitment, and show higher levels of well-being. In contrast, when they perceive unfairness in the workplace, they show signs of stress and withdrawal, and display more counterproductive work behaviors. Research has also provided explanations for employees’ reactions to perceived justice or injustice. It seems that perceptions of fairness are important to employees in assessing the fulfillment of a number of universal needs (Cropanzano, Rupp, Mohler, &amp; Schminke, 2001; Cropanzano, Byrne, Bobocel, &amp; Rupp, 2001). That is, employees care about fairness out of selfinterest (ie, to maximize their outcomes and fulfill needs for control; Gillespie &amp; Greenberg, 2005); they care about fairness out of relational concerns (ie, to solidify …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Deborah E Rupp and Patrick M Wright and Samuel Aryee and Yadong Luo', 'eprint': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Deborah_Rupp/publication/276117152_Organizational_Justice_Behavioral_Ethics_and_Corporate_Social_Responsibility_Finally_the_Three_Shall_Merge/links/55623f5608ae9963a11b4984/Organizational-Justice-Behavioral-Ethics-and-Corporate-Social-Responsibility-Finally-the-Three-Shall-Merge.pdf', 'title': 'THREE SEEMINGLY DISPARATE LITERATURES', 'url': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Deborah_Rupp/publication/276117152_Organizational_Justice_Behavioral_Ethics_and_Corporate_Social_Responsibility_Finally_the_Three_Shall_Merge/links/55623f5608ae9963a11b4984/Organizational-Justice-Behavioral-Ethics-and-Corporate-Social-Responsibility-Finally-the-Three-Shall-Merge.pdf'}, 'id_citations': 'u0irawQAAAAJ:MU1jWE1llqsC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small">//static.cambridge.org/content/id/urn%3Acambridge.org%3Aid%3Aarticle%3AS1740877600003090/resource/name/firstPage-S1740877600003090a.jpg</div></div>', 'author': 'Michael Harris Bond and Miriam Muethel and C Bram Cadsby and Fei Carrieri and Alexandre de Padua and Chao C Chen and Bor-Shiuan Cheng and Jae-Young Choe and Fariborz Damanpour and Deepa Aravind and Yunzhou Du and Roberto Gonzalez Duarte and Tony Fang and Joseph Galaskiewicz and Doug Guthrie and Hsu-Hung Hsieh and Xu Huang and Ying Huang and Liangding Jia and Shuyang You and Yunzhou Du and Runtian Jing and Kazuko Kojima and Jae-Young Choe and Takafumi Ohtomo and Yutaka Tsujinaka and G Zhiyong Lan and Joseph Galaskiewicz and Kwok Leung and Chenwei Li and Peter Ping Li and Kwok Leung and Chao C Chen and Jar-Der Luo and Shaomin Li and Jun Xia and Cheryl Xiaoning Long and Justin Tan and Wu Liu and Cheryl Xiaoning Long and Jar-Der Luo and Yadong Luo and Ying Huang and Stephanie Lu and Dali Ma and Mark F Peterson and Jeffrey J Reuer and Beverly B Tyler and Tony W Tong and Cheng-Wei Wu and Suzana B Rodrigues and Roberto Gonzalez Duarte and Alexandre de Padua Carrieri', 'journal': 'Theoretical Investigation', 'number': '2', 'pages': '311-340', 'title': 'Pan, Yaotian, Julie A.

Different variables were evaluated in order to optimize the reaction condition. Full characterizations were performed using UV-Vis, XRD, TEM, Size Distribution Analyzer and XPS. The results revealed that AgNPs were well dispersed with the diameters of 20~ 35 nm due to the package of xylan. The optimal condition was as follows: microwave irradiation temperature was 60~ 70 C, microwave power was 800 W, microwave time was 30 min, the ratio of xylan to AgNO3 was 50 mg: 0.13 mmol, and ammonia concentration was 2%. In addition, AgNPs were collected via high-speed centrifugal separation, meanwhile the supernatant was tested by HPAEC, GPC, FTIR, NMR. By comparing the structure of xylan before and after the reaction, the reaction mechanism was discussed. It was noted that xylan-AgNPs composites showed high selectivity and sensitivity for Hg2+ detection, the other 15 metal ions had no obvious effect on the detection of Hg2+, and the limit of detection (LOD) was 4.6 nM, which is lower than the allowed maximum level of 30 nM for drinking water by WHO. Besides, the xylan-AgNPs composites can also be applied for Hg2+ detection in real water samples. This study provides a novel way for high-value utilization of the rich biomass resource and a green method for synthesis of AgNPs for selective and sensitive detection of harmful heavy metal.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Yuqiong Luo and Suqin Shen and Jiwen Luo and Xiaoying Wang and Runcang Sun', 'eprint': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xiaoying_Wang3/publication/268085826_Green_synthesis_of_silver_nanoparticle_in_xylan_solution_via_Tollens_reaction_and_its_detection_for_Hg2/links/546ca3f90cf2b0bc8e539309/Green-synthesis-of-silver-nanoparticle-in-xylan-solution-via-Tollens-reaction-and-its-detection-for-Hg2.pdf', 'title': 'Nanoscale RSC', 'url': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xiaoying_Wang3/publication/268085826_Green_synthesis_of_silver_nanoparticle_in_xylan_solution_via_Tollens_reaction_and_its_detection_for_Hg2/links/546ca3f90cf2b0bc8e539309/Green-synthesis-of-silver-nanoparticle-in-xylan-solution-via-Tollens-reaction-and-its-detection-for-Hg2.pdf'}, 'id_citations': 'u0irawQAAAAJ:qStMeLs7OP8C', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Yadong Luo is the Emery M.
