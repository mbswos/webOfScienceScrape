Results indicate that the immediate negative reaction to fatal airline crashes is significant for only one full trading day after the event occurs. Hence, the market appears to assimilate the new information rapidly, even if the crash occurs in a remote geographic location. The paper also considers market response after the initial reaction period by assuming that the actual cumulative average residuals are drawn from the same distribution as the pre‐crash base period and by calculating the probabilities that observed changes would occur. Results provide no evidence that underreaction or overreaction appeared in the initial response period.

The ensuing public uproar had dramatic ramifications for the shares of GPU and for equity returns throughout the electric utility industry [4, 9]. Although utility stocks in general were affected, public utilities with commitments to nuclear power generation seem to have been hardest hit. The sharp downward stock price shifts appear to have been caused by investors\' changing risk perceptions, an occurrence likely to have affected bond issues as well. Clearly, potential creditors could be expected to react to the possibility of losses related to nuclear accidents, and to the prospect of larger marginal costs associated with compliance with stricter regulation by Public Utility Commissions.

Moreover, the contribution of consumer durables to economic activity has increased considerably over time, especially in the last decade, as illustrated in Fig. 1.

Eytan, Harpaz, and Krull (4) (EHK) developed a theoretical factor using Brownian motion to correct for the European terms and the bias due to the USDX index being expressed as a geometric average. Harpaz, Krull, and Yagil (5) empirically tested the EHK index. They used the historical volatility to proxy the EHK volatility specification.

By using market rates, different actuaries should achieve a higher degree of comparability when valuing pension liabilities of different firms. They should also achieve consistency in valuing liability streams over time. Furthermore, market rates serve as an anchor in liability valuation. They help to ensure that actuaries, pension sponsors and investment managers achieve objectivity in their pension liability measurement. Finally, discounting liabilities at market rates makes economic sense because there exists a market for these flows. Thus the use of market interest rates represents a truly important step in pension fund management.

Also, the fact that the Index remains a geometric average does not seem to introduce meaningful bias in Index pricing. Thus, the bias found in previous research was undoubtedly due primarily to the specification of both sides of an arbitrage leg in European terms. The results found here suggest that no systematic arbitrage can profitably be executed in the reformulated USDX futures contract.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'W Brian Barrett and Thomas B Sanders', 'eprint': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Thomas_Sanders4/publication/228218098_Adrift_No_More_The_Disappearance_of_the_Drift_Factor_in_the_New_US_Dollar_Index_Contract/links/544063bd0cf2fd72f99dd7b8.pdf', 'journal': 'Journal of Indexes, November/December', 'title': 'Adrift No More: The Disappearance of the Drift Factor in the New US Dollar Index Contract', 'url': 'https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=922774', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'Xf52Y1YAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div><div><div class="gsh_csp">Banks are known to use non-price terms in arriving at an effective loan rate. We demonstrate that international commercial banks use similar ‘credit rationing’ terms in pricing medium-term sovereign debt. Specifically, bankers adjust the loan rate, the maturity, and grace period in order to accommodate borrowers, specific needs while maintaining a fair return for the risk of the loan. These taken together comprise an all-in effective loan rate. We present a unique model using two stage least squares, which can easily be used to determine loan mispricing. The model is demonstrated using simulated loan pricing data.</div></div></div></div></div>', 'author': 'Thomas B Sanders and W Brian Barrett and Michael Palmer', 'eprint': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1042443100000524', 'journal': 'Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money', 'number': '2', 'pages': '223-237', 'publisher': 'North-Holland', 'title': 'A model for determining mispricing of sovereign risk loans', 'url': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1042443100000524', 'volume': '11', 'year': 2001}, 'id_citations': 'Xf52Y1YAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"> <div class="gsh_csp">This paper investigates the seasoning process of yield spreads between newly issued and seasoned 30‐year Treasury bonds. These securities provide a unique data set for analyzing this relationship in that they allow for control of noncoupon differences between securities that were present in previous studies on corporate bonds. The results indicate that, in contrast to the existing literature, there appears to be a price premium for newly issued securities. We attribute this difference primarily to be a function of a higher degree of liquidity inherent to newly issued Treasury bonds.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Dennis J Lasser and W Brian Barrett', 'eprint': 'http://search.proquest.com/openview/aac57738e9d998a629f8bcfde86c70e6/1.pdf?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=37348', 'journal': 'Financial Review', 'number': '2', 'pages': '237-247', 'publisher': 'Blackwell Publishing Ltd', 'title': 'New Issue Yield Spreads in the 30‐Year Treasury Bond Market', 'url': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-6288.1991.tb00379.x', 'volume': '26', 'year': 1991}, 'id_citations': 'Xf52Y1YAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Barrett, WB, Heuson, A &amp; Kolb, RW 1986,\'THE EFFECT OF IMPROVEMENT FUNDS ON BOND YIELD PREMIA\'Financial Review, vol. 21, no. 3, pp. 4. https://doi. org/10.1111/j. 1540-6288.1986. tb00668. x</div></div></div>', 'author': 'W Brian Barrett and Andrea Heuson and RW Kolb', 'journal': 'Financial Review', 'number': '3', 'pages': '4', 'publisher': 'Wiley-Blackwell', 'title': 'THE EFFECT OF IMPROVEMENT FUNDS ON BOND YIELD PREMIA', 'url': 'https://miami.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/the-effect-of-improvement-funds-on-bond-yield-premia', 'volume': '21', 'year': 1986}, 'id_citations': 'Xf52Y1YAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'author': 'William Brian Barrett', 'title': 'The structure of the market for large denomination negotiable certificates of deposit', 'url': 'https://smartech.gatech.edu/handle/1853/30406', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'Xf52Y1YAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Compensating balance requirements are an important feature of many commercial bank loans. Since compensating balances may affect the optimal cash holdings of the borrowing firm, it is important to incorporate these balances into the extant models of transactions demand for cash, including the familiar Baumol-Tobin and Miller-Orr models. While such an extension exists for the Miller-Orr model, the literature lacks a similarly augmented Baumol-Tobin model. In this article, we extend the Baumol-Tobin model along two separate tracks. First, we model the case of a bank that synchronizes the period over which it averages the firm’s cash balance to the firm’s cash replenishing cycle. This synchronous approach, which is new to the literature, explains why large firms, despite their greater negotiating power, hold relatively higher cash balances than small firms. This approach also shows why banks rarely impose …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'W Brian Barrett and Ricardo J Rodriguez and Thomas B Sanders', 'title': 'Compensating Balances, Synchronicity, and Firm Size', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14502673909817215596&hl=en&oi=scholarr'}, 'id_citations': 'Xf52Y1YAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C', 'source': 'citations'}]
