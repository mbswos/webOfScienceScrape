The magnitude of the revenue and welfare effects depend crucially on the price elasticity of demand. Previous studies in developing countries have found little if any impact of price on demand. These studies model the demand for health care as a discrete choice between alternative providers, with the price effect specified to be independent of income. 3/This assumption is extremely restrictive, since one would expect the wealthy to be less sensitive to price differences across providers than the poor. Indeed, we show that this specification is inconsistent with stable utility maximization, and that, if health is a normal good, the demand for health care must become more price elastic as income falls. The discrete choice specification in this paper is derived from a theoretical model that implies a natural interaction between price and income in the demand functions, and those demand functions are estimated using a parsimonious flexible functional form that allows the data to determine the effect of income on price elasticities. The resulting model facilitates the study of the distributional impacts of user fees. The empirical investigation considers the potential effects of user fees in urban Peru. The estimates show that price plays an important role in health care demand. Further, demand becomes more elastic as income falls indicating, as expected, that health is indeed a normal good.

The model is based on data from a 1984 household survey in Peru. In the context of the model, if health is a normal food, then the price elasticity of the demand for health care should decline as income increases. Unlike previous studies, the authors found that price plays a significant role in the demand for health care, and that demand becomes more elasticincome falls. This implies that user fees would refuce access to health care for the poor proportionaly more than for the rich. Possible frameworks were simuled for the impact of two different levels of fees on health care and welfare; it was shown that although user fees can generate substantial revenues for the health services, they would also produce a significant reduction in aggregate consumer welfare, to the detriment of the poor. Utilizing the frameworks, two specific cases were studied: in the first, persons in the bottom quintile of income were exempted from a fee increase, and in the second, the income generated by such an increase was used to construct more clinics and public hospitals. It was observed that when private physicians raised their prices proportionately to the increase, the frequency of visits of persons in the bottom quintile dropped</div></div>', 'author': 'Paul Gertler and Luis Locay and Warren Sanderson', 'eprint': 'http://iris.paho.org/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/17906/v103n6p635.pdf?sequence=1', 'title': 'Cuotas a los usuarios de los servicios de salud: Analisis de sus efectos potenciales en el Peru', 'url': 'http://iris.paho.org/xmlui/handle/123456789/17906', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 4, 'id_citations': 'vaFGiVwAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '4863269524549738994', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">All former communist countries undergoing transitions to market economies have faced the difficult question of whether or not to compensate those whose property had been confiscated by the previous, now deposed, regime. If a country determines that it will give compensation, it must then decide who will be eligible, how much compensation will be given, and what form it will take. In this paper we focus only on the issue of whether compensation should be in the form of restitution—the returning of property to the previous owners—or whether it should be some form of indemnification—the term we will use to designate compensation in the form of some asset (usually financial) other than the actual confiscated property.</div><div class="gsh_csp">While economists may be divided as to whether compensation of some form may increase efficiency, they are nearly unanimously in favor of indemnification over restitution. The argument is a simple one. Transition economies need to privatize quickly. Under a policy of restitution, title to property is not clear until claims are settled. Privatization must therefore wait for the resolution of property claims. Under indemnification the resolution of claims can proceed independently of the process of privatization.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Luis Locay and Cigdem Ural', 'eprint': 'http://www.ascecuba.org/c/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/v05-FILE19.pdf', 'journal': 'Cuba in Transition', 'pages': '246-52', 'title': 'Restitution vs. Indemnification: Their Effects on the Pace of Privatization', 'url': 'http://www.ascecuba.org/c/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/v05-FILE19.pdf', 'volume': '5', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 3, 'id_citations': 'vaFGiVwAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '14013698213900957710', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union have recently experienced political transformations that have resulted in a reduction, often very substantial, in the power of the ruling communists parties and other groups in their ruling coalitions.

Campos and Coricelli (2002) characterize as the “conventional wisdom” the view that these transition economies had high levels of human capital going into the transition because they compared favorably with Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries in terms of various indicators of education. Similar claims are often made for Cuba.

Since formal education is a major way individuals acquire productive skills, years of schooling and human capital should be related. The two measures, however, are not equivalent.

To see the importance of these magnitudes, consider that gross tourism earnings for 1999 were $1,901 million (Morris (2000)).

This paper examines the use of prenatal care among Peruvian women during 1982-84. It considers four dimensions of prenatal care behavior: (a) the decision to seek care; (b) the decision on where to seek care; (c) the decision on when to initiate care; and (d) the decision on the number of prenatal care visits. Our primary aim is to identify government policies that would facilitate the use of prenatal care. We use data from the Encuesta Nacional de Nutricion y Salud (the ENNSA survey) which is composed of a stratified random sample of 19277 households interviewed between April and November 1984 (INE 1986). Our study includes both a descriptive and an analytic analysis of these data. During 1982-84 82 percent of pregnant women in urban Peru had at least one prenatal care check-up. In rural areas that figure was 35 percent. The use of private prenatal care was similar in urban and rural areas 20 percent and 17 percent of all prenatal care respectively. Public care was much less common in rural areas. About 78 percent of all care in urban areas was in public facilities compared with around 53 percent in rural areas. The reduced use of public prenatal in rural areas compared with urban areas was balanced by a roughly comparable increase in the amount of care performed at home.

Average years of schooling have indeed risen sharply since the Revolution. For 15-64 year olds, years of education went from 4.2 years in 1960 to 9.8 in 2000, for an increase of 134%. 1 When looked at in the context of what happened to schooling in Latin America over this period, however, the increase does not appear as impressive. Consider two other countries—Chile and Costa Rica—that are often compared to Cuba. In 1960 their average years of schooling, 5.2 and 3.9 years, respectively, bracketed Cuba’s figure. By 2000, years of schooling in these two countries had increased to 9.1 and 8.0 years, or increases of 74% and 103%. Their increases are not as large as Cuba’s, but in the right ballpark.

Using Survey of Income and Education data, we distinguish between different Hispanic subgroups, we use a replicable and reasonably scaled measure of language proficiency, and (most notably) we take account of the possibility that language proficiency may be endogenous. We find that most of the difference in earnings between Hispanics and non-Hispanics is due to differences in characteristics (such as education level and English proficiency) rather than to labor market discrimination.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Luis Locay and Arthur Diamond', 'eprint': 'http://cba2.unomaha.edu/faculty/adiamond/WEB/DiamondPDFs/HISP14.pdf', 'journal': 'Annual Proceedings', 'publisher': 'The Association for the Study of the Cuban Economy', 'title': 'The Effect of Learning English on the Earnings of Hispanic Men', 'url': 'http://cba2.unomaha.edu/faculty/adiamond/WEB/DiamondPDFs/HISP14.pdf', 'volume': '1', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'vaFGiVwAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr">Base de dados : PAHO.

We model the accumulation of traditional human capital and English fluency, leading to the joint determination of the outcome variables. We find that speaking Spanish reduces test scores with no significant effect on completed schooling. The reduced test scores: 1) increase in three of the tests when the parents are more educated; 2) are more dramatic when the choice of home language is endogenous; and 3) are not systematically greater for verbal tests.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Luis Locay and Tracy L Regan and Arthur M Diamond Jr', 'eprint': 'http://moya.bus.miami.edu/~tregan/SpanishLanguage.pdf', 'title': 'The Effects of Spanish-Language Background on Completed Schooling and', 'url': 'http://moya.bus.miami.edu/~tregan/SpanishLanguage.pdf'}, 'id_citations': 'vaFGiVwAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC', 'source': 'citations'}]
