In unconditional tests, we find that more voluntary disclosure is associated with a lower cost of capital. However, consistent with the complementary association between disclosure and earnings quality, we find that the disclosure effect on cost of capital is substantially reduced or disappears completely (depending on the cost of capital proxy) once we condition on earnings quality.

Trust and transparency are predicted to have a positive association if corporate disclosures are viewed as more credible in high trust environments thereby increasing stakeholders’ demand for information. While competing theories predict a negative relation between trust and transparency, we document a robust positive empirical association between trust and financial transparency measures across countries.

Consistent with our hypotheses, we find that corporate boards in economically significant countries have more foreign directors from other economically significant countries, and common borders and geographic proximity increase cross-country appointments. We further find that the likelihood of a foreign appointment is lower for female directors and directors with a single board appointment, and higher for directors that are more experienced, holding a degree from an internationally ranked university, and those with higher reputation.

We propose an explanation for these differences based on the notion that insiders, in an attempt to protect their private control benefits, use earnings management to conceal firm performance from outsiders. Thus, earnings management is expected to decrease in investor protection because strong protection limits insiders’ ability to acquire private control benefits, which reduces their incentives to mask firm performance. Our findings are consistent with this prediction and suggest an endogenous link between corporate governance and the quality of reported earnings.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Christian Leuz and Dhananjay Nanda', 'journal': 'Corporate Governance and Corporate Finance', 'number': '3', 'pages': '623', 'title': 'and Peter D.

The authors hypothesized that the implementation of the IDTRS can improves corporate performance and that firms experience better corporate performance after the ranking scheme was revised in 2005. Furthermore, the authors analyzed the impact of information disclosure rankings on corporate performance in different ranking schemes and investigate the relationship between changes in disclosure rankings and corporate performance.

We present a model of common agency, where a risk-averse agent (the top management team) performs multiple tasks for a firm that is controlled by multiple principals (the board of directors) who differ in the relative value they place on each task. We show that the agent\'s incentives, and consequently firm value, are lower than they would be had the contract been offered by a single principal. Our empirical results are consistent with the model\'s predictions. Specifically, we find that board size is positively associated with objectives other than shareholder value maximization. Board size is negatively related to managerial incentives. Further, managerial incentives are positively related to firm performance and board size is negatively related to firm performance.
