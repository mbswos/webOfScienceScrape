We find that sovereign wealth funds largely invest to diversify away from industries at home but that they do so predominantly in countries that share the same culture, suggesting their investment rules are not entirely driven by profit maximizing objectives. Share prices of firms respond favorably when sovereign investment funds acquire stakes, in part because these investments often take place when firms are in financial distress.

Furthermore, within concentrated industries, the effect is especially pronounced among firms with weaker governance mechanisms prior to SOX.

Using a unique employer-employee matched data set from Germany, we find that the gender pay-gap decreases if child care provision is high. Women receive higher wage increases and are more likely to be promoted. Results are accentuated for the best paid and highly educated women. Child care provision should increase the pool of qualified women firms can draw from. In line with this view, we show that the negative stock market reaction to a mandated gender quota is mitigated for firms in counties with high child care provision.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Vidhi Chhaochharia and Suman Ghosh and Alexandra Niessen-Ruenzi and Christoph Schneider', 'eprint': 'https://site.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj8706/f/4804-latex_files_gender_disparitysite.pdf', 'journal': 'Available at SSRN 2943427', 'title': "Child care provision and women's careers in firms", 'url': 'https://papers.ssrn.com/Sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2943427', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 1, 'id_citations': '7ypz2aYAAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '9311473392264237621', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Fama and French (2012) find no significant global value premium among large stocks. Two simple departures from their methodology restore such premium: sorting stocks on price-to-earnings rather than price-to-book ratios, and using global rather than regional value breakpoints. The resulting global value premium among large stocks, measured as the return spread between top 30% and bottom 30% stocks, increases from 17 (t-stat= 1.09) to 64 (t-stat= 2.61) basis points per month. Using price-to-earnings computed from earnings estimates rather than historical earnings further sharpens the global value effect among large stocks. Not confined to small stocks, the value premium remains a highly economically significant phenomenon. Because valuation ratios are not interchangeable, researchers should consider looking beyond price-to-book when studying, or controlling for, the value effect.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Sandro C Andrade and Vidhi Chhaochharia', 'eprint': 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.712.80&rep=rep1&type=pdf', 'journal': 'Available at SSRN 2437567', 'title': 'Is There a Value Premium Among Large Stocks?', 'url': 'https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2437567', 'year': 2015}, 'citedby': 1, 'id_citations': '7ypz2aYAAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '8871212039228134639', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Using Eurozone data from 2005 to 2013, we find that the stock prices of firms vulnerable to financial intermediation disruption are particularly sensitive to changes in sovereign credit spreads. Such higher sensitivity is fully due to forward P/E ratios and not due to short% term expected earnings, indicating that stocks are priced as if sovereign risk has effects on vulnerable stocks beyond the short% term. Estimation of a structural model indicates that such longer% term effects are expected to be large. Our findings provide novel support for recently developed theories of sovereign default proposing that financial intermediation disruption is a key cost of sovereign default.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Sandro C Andrade and Vidhi Chhaochharia', 'eprint': 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.712.9317&rep=rep1&type=pdf', 'title': 'Sovereign risk, financial intermediation, and stock returns', 'url': 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.712.9317&rep=rep1&type=pdf', 'year': 2015}, 'citedby': 1, 'id_citations': '7ypz2aYAAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C', 'id_scholarcitedby': '4004422249110353', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">We propose a novel long) short value strategy that earns 87 basis points per month among large stocks in developed markets, compared to 14 basis per month of Fama and Frenchps (2012) global HML.

Regarding costs, to comply with CRA, rather than lend more overall, banks perfectly substitute away from small business lending to other income groups. Regarding benefits, 0.5% of the population is lifted out of poverty per year through the CRA small-business lending channel. The incidence of the act is on smaller banks who lend more and face higher loan losses.

We find that FCF agency conflicts cause (i) under-leverage, leading to higher corporate taxes and (ii) under-investment in PP&amp;E, leading to slower firm growth. Capital markets recognize FCF conflicts and discount such firms.
