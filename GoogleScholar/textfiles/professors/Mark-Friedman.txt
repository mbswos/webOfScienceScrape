A comprehensive managerial accounting case-study, Light (Building Block of Accounting–A Managerial Perspective, I See The Light), has been created using these emerging technologies to create the following: a unique case for each student, an artificial intelligent grading modular, a twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week high speed feedback modular capable of providing unlimited feedback, all with no additional instructor resources. We can now provide students with an internet leaning tool never before possible. Based on previous studies, this tool may be able to improve students’ attitude and performance. In this study, students downloaded Light from an internet site, http://www. cybertext. com, worked at their own pace and uploaded an answer sheet whenever they wanted feedback. Cybertext graded the students\' solution every time they uploaded their work to the server, keeping the latest score as the case study score. A multiple regression analysis of the final exam score on the case study score and the number of uploads the students used was analyzed. This study rejected the null hypothesis stating that this case study has no affect on the student’s performance in the final exam score, concluding that it has statistically significant effect on the student’s performance in the course’s final exam.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Mark Friedman and Avi Rushinek and Sara Rushinek', 'eprint': 'http://www.aejournal.com/ojs/index.php/aej/article/viewFile/32/32', 'journal': "The Accounting Educators' Journal", 'title': 'The effect on achievement of using emerging technology in the managerial accounting course', 'url': 'http://www.aejournal.com/ojs/index.php/aej/article/viewFile/32/32', 'volume': '16', 'year': 2006}, 'citedby': 8, 'id_citations': 'FxtqJhYAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C', 'id_scholarcitedby': '1344557126593294485', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Six Sigma has been called the latest incarnation of Total Quality Management (TQM). The name simply means that customer-specified tolerances for acceptable output are six standard deviations from the mean. Six Sigma management has high training costs. Specifications state a boundary that applies to individual units of a product or service. In Six Sigma these specification limits are called the" voice of the customer." Six Sigma management promotes the idea that the voice of the process should take up no more than half of the tolerance allowed by the voice of the customer, a process that transforms inputs into outputs through the addition or creation of value. The relationship between the voice of the customer, the voice of the process, and the DMAIC model is explained.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Mark Friedman and Howard Gitlow', 'eprint': 'http://search.proquest.com/openview/b08224eff4dedd8cbcb9399a2f4804b8/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=41798', 'journal': 'The CPA Journal', 'number': '11', 'pages': '56', 'publisher': 'New York State Society of Certified Public Accountants', 'title': 'Six Sigma primer for CPAS', 'url': 'http://search.proquest.com/openview/b08224eff4dedd8cbcb9399a2f4804b8/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=41798', 'volume': '72', 'year': 2002}, 'citedby': 8, 'id_citations': 'FxtqJhYAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '16375080692046013228', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"> <div class="gsh_csp">The authors of this article see internal audit as a within‐firm tool that provides a new lens for cost management.
