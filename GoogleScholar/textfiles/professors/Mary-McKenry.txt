Forty percent used child care for more than 75% of their children\'s lives, 20% did when not employed. Preschool children born preterm were more likely to receive child care from nonrelatives throughout their lives than children born full term. Children with health problems used a greater number of child care arrangements. Findings suggest addressing child care issues with both employed and nonemployed mothers and adequacy of child care for children with special needs.</div></div></div></div>', 'author': 'JoAnne M Youngblut and Dorothy Brooten and Sandra L Lobar and Laura Hernandez and Mary McKenry', 'eprint': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0882596305000333', 'journal': 'Journal of pediatric nursing', 'number': '4', 'pages': '246-257', 'publisher': 'WB Saunders', 'title': 'Child care use by low-income single mothers of preschoolers born preterm versus those of preschoolers born full term', 'url': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0882596305000333', 'volume': '20', 'year': 2005}, 'citedby': 8, 'id_citations': '63sKjWgAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C', 'id_scholarcitedby': '1321836825151669087', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Deming-based Lean Six-Sigma management is applied to the Emergency Department (ED) of a large metropolitan university hospital to demonstrate the effectiveness of using Deming\'s approaches to improve processes which will allow a reduction in the length of time the patient remains within the ED. A Voice of Customer analysis is utilized to identify priorities for improvement. Change concepts are utilized for the development of the changes that will improve the ED length of stay. Control charts are used to illustrate the estimated effect of implementation of the proposed changes.
