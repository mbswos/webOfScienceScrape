Recent theoretical articles have explored why or how underreaction might occur. However, the notion of underreaction is contentious. We revisit this issue by focusing on one of the most simple of corporate transactions, the stock split. Prior studies that report abnormal return drifts subsequent to splits do not appear to be spurious, nor a consequence of misspecified benchmarks. Using recent cases, we report a drift of 9% in the year following a split announcement. We consider fundamental operating performance as a source of the underreaction and find that splitting firms have an unusually low propensity to experience a contraction in future earnings. Further, analysts’ earnings forecasts are comparatively low at the time of the split announcement and revise sluggishly over time.

However, it is often difficult and time-consuming to identify earnings management, especially in generic settings where an obvious incentive to manage earnings is absent. While academic research has used numerous proxies for (or diagnostics of) earnings management, most recent studies use accruals models to decompose total accruals into a normal, economics-driven component and an abnormal, earnings management component. 1 McNichols (2000) points out, however, that there is limited theory about how accruals should behave in the absence of discretion, and Fields, Lys, and Vincent (2001) argue that the use of existing accruals models may lead to serious inference problems.

Further, we show that analysts incorporate into their forecast revisions only some, but not all, of the differential persistence between in-sync and out-of sync earnings surprises.

This pronouncement states that consolidated financial statements are “usually necessary for a fair presentation when one of the companies in the group directly or indirectly has a controlling interest in the other companies,” 9 and that the “usual condition for a controlling financial interest is ownership of a majority voting interest.” 10 Since then, it has become abundantly clear that in many cases the more than 50% voting interest rule is not effective at identifying who really controls, and should thereby consolidate an entity. In response, the FASB issued FIN 46, following it shortly thereafter with FIN 46 (R). These pronouncements introduced a new consolidation model, not based on voting power, to determine when a controlling financial interest exists and who holds it. This model has been …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Oscar J Holzmann and Sundaresh Ramnath', 'eprint': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/jcaf.21801', 'journal': 'Journal of Corporate Accounting & Finance', 'number': '6', 'pages': '77-81', 'publisher': 'Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Company', 'title': 'VIE guidance continues to expand', 'url': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcaf.21801', 'volume': '23', 'year': 2012}, 'id_citations': '8b8N7P4AAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">This surveys reviews research regarding the role of financial analysts in capital markets. The survey builds on the perspectives provided by Schipper (1991) and Brown (1993). We categorize papers published mainly since 1992 and selectively discuss aspects of these papers that address or suggest key research topics of ongoing interest in seven broad areas: analysts\' decision processes, the determinants of analyst expertise and distributions of individual analysts\' forecasts, the informativeness of analysts\' research outputs, analyst and market efficiency with respect to information, effects of analysts\' economic incentives on their research outputs, effects of the institutional and regulatory environment (including cross-country comparisons), and the limitations of databases and various research paradigms.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Sundaresh Ramnath and Steve Rock and Philip B Shane', 'journal': 'Foundations and Trends® in Finance', 'number': '4', 'pages': '311-421', 'title': 'Foundations and Trends® in Finance', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1722219832345108045&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'volume': '2', 'year': 2008}, 'id_citations': '8b8N7P4AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">When firms manage earnings up (down), the articulation between the income statement and the balance sheet generally forces a simultaneous increase (decrease) in net operating assets. Therefore, under ceteris paribus conditions, upward earnings management results in a contemporaneous increase in profit margin (ie, operating income divided by sales) and decrease in asset turnover (ie, sales divided by net operating assets), and downward earnings management results in a contemporaneous decrease in profit margin and increase in asset turnover. We provide evidence that the sign-interaction between the change in profit margin and the change in asset turnover is indeed useful for identifying earnings management with analyses that rely on the following notions:(1) earnings management reverses,(2) firms that meet or just beat analyst forecasts are more likely to have managed earnings upward, and (3) firms that miss or beat analyst forecasts by a large amount are more likely to have managed earnings downward. In all analyses our earnings management diagnostic is incrementally informative to abnormal accruals, a widely accepted measure of earnings management.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Ivo Ph Jansen and Sundaresh Ramnath and Teri Lombardi Yohn', 'eprint': 'https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7571/29c3fd302663a88bc33315ae200d00a1d64f.pdf', 'title': 'Changes in Asset Turnover and Profit Margin as Signals of Earnings Management', 'url': 'https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7571/29c3fd302663a88bc33315ae200d00a1d64f.pdf', 'year': 2008}, 'id_citations': '8b8N7P4AAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">SEC Regulation SX requires companies to reconcile deviations between their actual tax expense and their expected tax expense under federal statutory tax rates (effective tax rate (ETR) reconciliation). However, companies can choose between a dollar or percentage format for the ETR reconciliation. In our sample, roughly half the firms choose one of the two formats. We investigate the causes and consequences of this disclosure decision. We find, consistent with a political cost argument, that firms with low (high) ETRs tend to highlight the dollar (percentage) amount of their tax expense, suggesting a strategic choice of presentation method. We also find that users such as analysts seem to find the percentage format easier to use and tend to make smaller errors in their ETR forecasts when firms present their ETR reconciliation in the percentage format, consistent with analysts’ comfort (struggles) when information is …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Roman Chychyla and Diana Falsetta and Sundaresh Ramnath', 'title': 'Determinants and Consequences of Presentation Format: The Case of ETR Reconciliations', 'url': 'https://business.illinois.edu/accountancy/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2017/09/Tax-Symposium-2017-Session-III-b.pdf'}, 'id_citations': '8b8N7P4AAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC', 'source': 'citations'}]
