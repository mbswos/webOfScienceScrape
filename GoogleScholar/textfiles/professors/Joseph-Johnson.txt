The goal of the present research is to extend previous literature that fills this void by presenting a model that attempts to describe the link between the use of different strategies and the subsequent option-generation process, as well as the resulting choice characteristics.

Although prospect theory is widely accepted, other authors have sought the inclusion of reference points besides the status quo. Initially these extensions focused on the importance of single reference points such as goals. More recently, authors have explained choice data by including multiple reference points within the value function.

The current work seeks to remedy this disparity by combining the advantages of work in decision research (mouse-tracing paradigms with contingent information display) and cognitive psychology (eye-tracking paradigms from reading and scene perception). In particular, we introduce a new decision moving-window paradigm that presents stimulus information contingent on eye fixations. We provide data from the first application of this method to risky decision making, and show how it compares to basic eye-tracking and mouse-tracing methods. We also enumerate the practical, theoretical, and analytic advantages this method offers above and beyond both mouse-tracing with occlusion and basic eye tracking of information without occlusion. We include the use of new metrics that offer more precision than those typically calculated on mouse-tracing data as well as those not possible or feasible within the mouse-tracing paradigm.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Ana M Franco-Watkins and Joseph G Johnson', 'eprint': 'http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~baron/journal/11/m23/m23.pdf', 'journal': 'Judgment & Decision Making', 'number': '8', 'title': 'Applying the decision moving window to risky choice: Comparison of eye-tracking and mouse-tracing methods.', 'url': 'http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~baron/journal/11/m23/m23.pdf', 'volume': '6', 'year': 2011}, 'citedby': 39, 'id_citations': '3ub2YLkAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '12131747770736523912', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Computational models are like ‘the new kids in town’for the field of decision making. Initially, this field was dominated by axiomatic utility theories, which are formulated as simple algebraic models (see Bell, Raiffa, &amp; Tversky, 1998; Luce, 2000). Empirical violations of axioms led to the rise of heuristic decision models, which are usually described by simple verbal rules of thumb (see Gigerenzer, Todd, &amp; The ABC Research Group, 1999; Payne, Bettman, &amp; Johnson, 1993). It is difficult for ‘the new kids’ to break into this field for a very important reason: they just seem too complex. Computational models are constructed from a large number of elementary units that are tightly interconnected to form a complex dynamical system. So the question is raised–what does this extra complexity buy us? Computational theorists first have to prove that their models are worth the extra complexity.

There are different types of decisions that we must make as well. For example, when planning for a vacation, someone may make a detailed, logical analysis concerning where to go. Along the way, he may then use simple rules to decide when and where to stop and which specific routes to take, depending on incidental factors such as traffic. It is important to understand how these various decision domains are differently perceived and processed. On the one hand, under novel decision-making conditions, there is no prior experience to guide the decision-making process. In this case, how does one select the appropriate strategy? On the other hand, under repetitive decision-making conditions, there is a long history of experience. In this case, are some decisions truly automatic in the sense that they require no deliberation? In this chapter, we address the issue of how decision processes transit from more controlled or deliberative strategies, to simple decision rules, and finally to automatic or routine strategies.

Decision researchers have struggled for a long time with the fact that preferences are highly changeable and vary in complex ways across contexts and tasks. For example, reversals have been observed when preferences are measured by binary versus triadic choice sets, or when preferences are measured by choice versus price methods. Several theoretical approaches have been developed to understand this puzzling variability in preferences. One approach is to modify the classic utility model by allowing the weights or values that enter the utility function to change across contexts or tasks. For example, Tversky, Sattath, &amp; Slovic (1988) believe that the decision weights for attributes change across choice versus price tasks. A second approach is to use different heuristic rules to form preferences, depending on task and context. For example, Payne, Bettman, and Johnson (1993) propose that decision makers switch from compensatory to noncompensatory types of rules when the number of options increases or as time pressure increases. Both of these approaches are well established and have made a large impact on decision research.</div><div class="gsh_csp">This chapter presents a computational approach to understanding how preferences change across contexts and tasks.

Our results indicate that although participants change search strategies during the most restricted times, the occurrence of the shift in strategies depends both on how the constraints are applied as well as individual differences in working memory. This suggests that, in situations that require making decisions under time constraints, one can influence performance by being sensitive to working …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Ana M Franco-Watkins and Matthew E Davis and Joseph G Johnson', 'eprint': 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13414-016-1173-9', 'journal': 'Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics', 'number': '8', 'pages': '2363-2372', 'publisher': 'Springer US', 'title': 'The ticking time bomb: Using eye-tracking methodology to capture attentional processing during gradual time constraints', 'url': 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13414-016-1173-9', 'volume': '78', 'year': 2016}, 'citedby': 1, 'id_citations': '3ub2YLkAAAAJ:NaGl4SEjCO4C', 'id_scholarcitedby': '9556651762613850369', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div><div><div class="gsh_csp">This concluding chapter is written as an exercise in evaluative and formative outcome assessment for the workshop that produced the individual content chapters in this edited volume (entitled <i>Mind and motion: the bidirectional link between thought and action</i>; 29–31 May 2008; Bielefeld, Germany).

For example, they demonstrate how eye-tracking can reveal information about visual attention (Chapters 1–5), how motor movements can indicate intention (Chapters 8–10), and how these claims and others are supported on even a neuronal level (Chapters 14–16). Across these methods, process tracing creates a vast amount of rich, dynamic data. While this allows for utilization of more sophisticated analytic techniques (Chapter 22) to draw sharper conclusions, it can also serve as a significant practical challenge. This chapter illustrates the benefits of using computational models as a framework for organizing and interpreting process data to its fullest potential. We propose that the use of computational cognitive models (CCM) allows for direct specification of cognitive processes that is different than—and arguably superior to—relying on differences across group means and other methods to learn about behavior. We will introduce the general pursuit of computational modeling, then cover work that has implemented and/or verified CCMs using a variety of process data types, ranging from movements of the hands and eyes to 256-channel electrodes measuring brain activity. Our goal is to demonstrate unique application of CCMs to process data in enough detail to serve the new researcher who desires to develop and apply CCMs in their research to better understand and relate constructs of interest.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Joseph G Johnson and Mary E Frame', 'journal': 'A Handbook of Process Tracing Methods', 'pages': '374', 'publisher': 'Routledge', 'title': 'USING PROCESS TRACING DATA TO DEFINE AND TEST PROCESS MODELS1', 'url': 'http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=jiCeDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA374&dq=info:9t79fubHU2gJ:scholar.google.com&ots=CciuG2PbKD&sig=1rVS6Aw1mUuP4CjW-kXR_WB1_Ks', 'year': 2019}, 'id_citations': '3ub2YLkAAAAJ:LPZeul_q3PIC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Eye-tracking methodology is widely used in the behavioral sciences such as judgment and decision making (JDM), marketing, or human computer interaction.

While behavioral researchers frequently apply eye-tracking, methodological research on eye-tracking is mainly conducted by vision researchers and published in vision journals. Consequently, methodological research is not always noticed by behavioral or applied researchers. In this chapter we aim to bridge the gap between methodological and behavioral eye-tracking research by providing an overview of best practices for eye-tracking research. The structure of the chapter corresponds to a typical research project beginning with research questions and progressing to experimental design, implementation of the experiment, data collection, data preprocessing and analysis, and finally interpretation of results.

Recently, rankdependent theories (eg cumulative prospect theory) have arisen as the “leading” descriptive approach. A key component of these theories is the decision weight that reflects the importance of consequences when evaluating an action. Several researchers have had success in fitting functional forms for decision weights to account for empirical data. However, little is known about the cognitive source of these weights. The current work presents a computational model that derives decision weights from elementary attentional processing mechanisms. This approach provides a way to model the cognitive processes that underlie importance weighting, rather than only the resultant weights. It is shown how the model provides a coherent explanation for several robust phenomena including some that cannot be explained by rank-dependent utility theories.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Joseph G Johnson and Jerome R Busemeyer', 'eprint': 'http://www.academia.edu/download/42741/2908b7qqsicyx8ud8wi8.pdf', 'title': 'A computational model of the attention process used to generate decision weights', 'url': 'http://www.academia.edu/download/42741/2908b7qqsicyx8ud8wi8.pdf', 'year': 2008}, 'id_citations': '3ub2YLkAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">This talk will introduce and briefly survey the usefulness of cognitive modeling of decision making in sports.

Our approach is a clear departure from—and possesses marked advantages over—the traditional method that has dominated the field for decades. We rely instead on a dynamic framework that has been successfully applied to many other cognitive domains, such as memory and categorization. Specifically, we apply sequential sampling principles across several distinct but interconnected levels to model a variety of processes that serve decision making. Descriptive theories of human decision making have roots in normative analyses of rational decisions. The primitive element of these theories is a holistic value, or expected utility, for any given option. This utility integrates the subjective values of the different dimensions of an option, or the different outcomes of a probabilistic event. Early utility theories supposed this integration was a simple weighted (by outcome probability) sum of outcome values. However, decades of empirical research have refuted this model as a descriptive account of human behavior. Most decision researchers have responded with amendments to the basic model such as by adding parameters, relaxing assumptions, or requiring specific functional forms in allowing for subjective assessment of probability and value.

There are different types of decisions that we must make as well. For example, when planning for a vacation, someone may make a detailed, logical analy-sis concerning where to go. Along the way, he may then use simple rules to decide when and where to stop and which specific routes to take, depending on incidental factors such as traffic. It is important to understand how these various decision domains are differently perceived and processed. On the one hand, under novel decision-making conditions, there is no prior experience to guide the decision-making process. In this case, how does one select the appropriate strategy? On the other hand, under repetitive decision-making conditions, there is a long history of experience. In this case, are some decisions truly automatic in the sense that they require no deliberation? In this chapter, we …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Joseph G Johnson and Jerome R Busemeyer', 'eprint': 'https://www.users.miamioh.edu/johnsojg/lab/papers/JB_05.pdf', 'title': 'Decision-Making Strategies', 'url': 'https://www.users.miamioh.edu/johnsojg/lab/papers/JB_05.pdf'}, 'id_citations': '3ub2YLkAAAAJ:f2IySw72cVMC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Decision research has experienced a shift from simple algebraic theories of choices to an appreciation of mental processes that precede and produce those choices. An important development has been an increasing number and variety of process-tracing methods that can help verifying these assumed process explanations. Here, we provide a comprehensive yet concise survey of these methods, including specific examples for verbal protocols, information boards, eye-tracking and mousetracking tools to illustrate their research value and contributions to theory building and testing. We show how these techniques can inform phenomena as varied as attention, emotion, strategy use, and developing intentions. Two important future developments are identified: broadening the number of explicit tests of proposed processes through formal modeling and defining standards and best-practices for data collection.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Michael Schulte-Mecklenbeck and Joseph G Johnson and Ulf Böckenholt and Daniel G Goldstein and J Edward Russo and Nikki Sullivan and Martijn C Willemsen', 'eprint': 'https://psyarxiv.com/ept9b/download', 'title': 'Author Note', 'url': 'https://psyarxiv.com/ept9b/download'}, 'id_citations': '3ub2YLkAAAAJ:cFHS6HbyZ2cC', 'source': 'citations'}]
