We introduce a classification scheme that assigns loss firm‐years into three categories based on whether management appears to have recognized a material change in the VA, and whether or not the firm has positive taxable income (e.g., a net operating loss). The results of our study show that our tax categories contain information about the persistence of accounting losses over the following three years beyond variables previously identified to predict loss persistence. This incremental information is consistent with management using private information about the firm\'s future prospects in setting the VA. Finally, we find that investors’ pricing of the VA varies with the saliency of the tax signal and the information …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Dan S Dhaliwal and Steven E Kaplan and Rick C Laux and Eric Weisbrod', 'eprint': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2012.00466.x', 'journal': 'Journal of Accounting Research', 'number': '1', 'pages': '135-164', 'publisher': 'Blackwell Publishing Inc', 'title': 'The information content of tax expense for firms reporting losses', 'url': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2012.00466.x', 'volume': '51', 'year': 2013}, 'citedby': 56, 'id_citations': 'Ou1Ym2MAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '15622159685639860427', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div><div><div class="gsh_csp">This research note extends the research on ethical decision making in accounting by examining the effect of two variables, affect and tolerance of ambiguity, on ethics-related decisions made in two contexts: both personal and organizational settings.

These individuals can belong to the same or different accounting firms and through multiple and repeated collaborations they form a professional network. We use network measures of centrality to capture individuals\' ability to acquire and apply tax expertise across clients. We demonstrate that clients engaging better-connected individual auditors have comparatively lower effective tax rates. Our results are robust to controlling for a number of client, individual, and accounting firm characteristics, as well as for alternative network connections between clients. We also use instrumental variables, individual fixed effects, and matching to mitigate the effect of endogenous pairing of clients and auditors.

We utilize a matched-sample research design to show that first-time GCARs are associated with incremental negative abnormal returns and increases in market-adjusted share turnover at the annual report filing date. Moreover, our results indicate that greater net selling by institutional investors (ie, institutional flight) during the fiscal year increases the magnitude of these associations. We also find that first-time GCARs signal an increased likelihood of bankruptcy and weaker operating performance in the subsequent year, and that institutional flight prior to the GCAR moderates the severity of these signals. Taken together, our findings provide new evidence that first-time GCARs are incrementally informative beyond other financial statement information, and that the informativeness of the auditor’s GCAR decision is moderated by the observed trading decisions of institutional investors.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Steven E Kaplan and Michael J Mowchan and Eric H Weisbrod', 'eprint': 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.648.8020&rep=rep1&type=pdf', 'journal': 'Available at SSRN 2433626', 'title': 'Does institutional investor behavior influence the market reaction to going concern audit reports?', 'url': 'https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2433626', 'year': 2014}, 'citedby': 5, 'id_citations': 'Ou1Ym2MAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '8979843377407996084', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Street earnings are non-GAAP earnings, adjusted for consistency with the analyst majority basis and disseminated by forecast data providers (FDPs). We find that the time it takes an FDP to incorporate street earnings in its products (activation delay, hereafter) reflects variation in the difficulty of constructing street earnings, investor demand for timely street earnings, and FDPs\' limited attention and resources. Furthermore, the market reaction to reported earnings is more timely when activation delay is shorter, and price discovery is highly concentrated during the hour after street earnings are activated. Finally, activation delay increases the delay with which street earnings are incorporated in analyst forecasts. We conclude that frictions in information processing prevent market participants from instantaneously constructing and incorporating street earnings in their decisions, and that FDPs play a key role in alleviating these frictions.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Khrystyna Bochkay and Stanimir Markov and Musa Subasi and Eric H Weisbrod', 'eprint': 'https://msb.georgetown.edu/sites/msb/files/documents/musa_subasi_paper_streetearningsactivationdelay.pdf', 'title': 'Street earnings activation delay', 'url': 'https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3219449', 'year': 2018}, 'citedby': 3, 'id_citations': 'Ou1Ym2MAAAAJ:t7zJ5fGR-2UC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '9907537776796303980', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">The extant literature has focused on the relation between earnings and returns (ie, change in value).

The primary contribution of our paper is to add analysis of the relation between earnings and free cash flow. We show that:(1) free cash flow explains more of operating income than is explained by returns;(2) the difference in the portion of negative cf. positive enterprise returns captured in operating income is similar to the portion of negative cf. positive equity returns captured in earnings reported in the extant literature and this portion is different if there is net cash inflow vs. net cash outflow;(3) the portion of each source of change in value captured in operating income changes with leverage, thus, we extend the extant literature on the effect of leverage on “conservative” accounting;(4) leverage varies with type of investment and, since the accounting varies with the type of investment, the portions of change in value captured in operating income varies, thus, we provide an alternative explanation for the relation between leverage and the degree of conservatism in accounting.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Peter Easton and Peter Vassallo and Eric Weisbrod', 'eprint': 'https://www.cba.uh.edu/departments/accy/research/documents/Easton.pdf', 'title': 'Accounting Earnings and Free Cash Flow', 'url': 'https://www.cba.uh.edu/departments/accy/research/documents/Easton.pdf', 'year': 2017}, 'citedby': 3, 'id_citations': 'Ou1Ym2MAAAAJ:VLnqNzywnoUC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '17794043940659783577', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"> <div class="gsh_csp">Using both investor‐ and stock‐level data, I examine the relation between stockholders’ unrealized returns since purchase and the market response to earnings announcements.

Findings using archival stock market and earnings data suggest that stock prices behave as if investors do not fully understand the quarterly earnings-generating process.
