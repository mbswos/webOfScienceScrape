In this paper, we investigate the benefits from supplier diversification for dual-sourcing duopolists. We consider a two-echelon supply chain in which suppliers sell components to buyers who produce and sell substitutable products. The suppliers\' output processes are uncertain and modeled as having a proportional random yield. Buyers engage in a quantity-based Cournot competition. We find that an increase in supplier correlation leads to more correlated buyers\' outputs and a decrease in their profits. In the presence of end-market competition, dual sourcing still brings value by reducing the inefficiency caused by random yield: Namely, when the suppliers\' yield processes are strongly negatively correlated, dual sourcing increases the expected market output and improves the firms\' profits over sole sourcing.

To mitigate delivery risk, buyers may either source from multiple suppliers or offer incentives to their preferred supplier to improve its process reliability. These incentives can be either direct (investment subsidy) or indirect (inflated order quantity). In this study, we present a series of models to highlight buyers’ and suppliers’ optimal parameter choices. Our base‐case model has deterministic buyer demand and two possibilities for the supplier yield outcomes: all‐or‐nothing supply or partial disruption. For the all‐or‐nothing model, we show that the buyer prefers to only use the subsidy option, which obviates the need to inflate order quantity. However, in the partial disruption model, both incentives—subsidy and order inflation—may be used at the same time. Although single sourcing provides greater indirect incentive to the selected supplier because that avoids …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Sammi Y Tang and Haresh Gurnani and Diwakar Gupta', 'eprint': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/poms.12160', 'journal': 'Production and Operations Management', 'number': '7', 'pages': '1198-1211', 'title': 'Managing disruptions in decentralized supply chains with endogenous supply process reliability', 'url': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12160', 'volume': '23', 'year': 2014}, 'citedby': 90, 'id_citations': '-CUEbDQAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C', 'id_scholarcitedby': '3479334214974813489', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">We consider coordination issues in supply chains where supplier\'s production process is subject to random yield losses. For a simple supply chain with a single supplier and retailer facing deterministic demand, a pay back contract which has the retailer paying a discount price for the supplier\'s excess units can provide the right incentive for the supplier to increase his production size and achieve coordination. Building upon this result, we consider coordination issues for two other supply chains: one with competing retailers, the other with stochastic demand. When retailers compete for both demand and supply, they tend to over‐order. We show that a combination of a pay back and revenue sharing mechanism can coordinate the supply chain, with the pay back mechanism correcting the supplier\'s under‐producing problem and the revenue sharing mechanism correcting the retailers\' over‐ordering problem.

A general modeling framework is developed to optimize retailers’ order quantities under any possible flexibility level of a stylized two-stage distribution network. We apply the framework to formulate and solve the transshipment problem of a distribution network with three retailers.

At the completion time of the first stage, the retailer has the option to expedite a portion of the replenishment order via an alternative faster supply mode.

To manage this risk, firms can purchase interruption insurance and/or deploy operational measures such as storing inventory or taking preparedness actions that reduce the expected interruption length. In this study, we explore inventory, preparedness, and insurance in a two‐stage production chain that can experience disruptions at either the upstream or downstream stage. We analytically characterize an inventory‐only model and a preparedness‐only model in which the firm uses either inventory or preparedness effort to manage disruption risk, and a joint model in which the firm deploys both operational measures.

Firms may choose either a delegation or control approach to manage these suppliers. Under information proximity, ie, when information about higher-tier suppliers becomes more transparent as supply chain distances decreases, firms can benefit from delegating higher-tier supplier management to the better informed middle-tier supplier, but can also face increased risks due to loss of direct monitoring and control. To better understand the impact of sourcing structure on firms’ profit and supply chain risk, in this paper we consider a three-tier supply chain consisting of a buying firm, a Tier-1 supplier, and Tier-2 suppliers, where risk stems from unauthorized Tier-2 suppliers. In delegation, the firm leaves Tier-2 supplier selection and auditing responsibility to Tier-1 supplier. In control, the firm directly makes these decisions. We find that under information proximity a profit-maximizing firm weakly prefers delegation to control. Delegation is sufficient in managing risks when the supply chain faces high expected external penalty and small price difference between authorized and unauthorized suppliers, and produces products with high profit margin. Otherwise, delegation exposes the supply chain to a higher risk, where influence by other stakeholders may help induce the socially-desired outcome. We give cautions to frequent supplier inspection by NGOs since it may backfire when the auditing cost is low. Furthermore, we find that more information about suppliers may not necessarily increase the buying firm’s …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Sammi Tang and Jeannette Song', 'title': 'The Effect of Information Proximity on Multi-tier Responsible Sourcing', 'url': 'https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3396843', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': '-CUEbDQAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Patient no‐shows and late cancellations lead to clinic inefficiency, high clinic costs and low patient satisfaction. The two main strategies clinics employed to alleviate the adverse effects of no‐shows are overbooking and patient appointment reminders. Developing effective overbooking schedules depends on accurately predicting each patient’s no‐show probability, while developing effective reminder systems requires a patient‐level estimate of communication sensitivity. Current methods of estimating no‐show probabilities do not produce such patient‐level predictions. To remedy this, we develop a Bayesian nested logit model which utilizes appointment confirmation data and estimates individual‐level coefficients for patient‐specific predictors.

After the buyers know their own demand, they place purchase orders (called firm orders). These orders are often placed very close to the production start time or even after the production start time so that it is not possible for the manufacturer to revise its production schedule. The discrepancies between the soft order and the firm order often result in high excess inventories at the manufacturer. Without any commitment related to the soft orders by the buyers and the production by the manufacturer, the soft orders are often not effective. We hence propose a penalty contract, through which the buyers pay a penalty for canceling some portion of their soft orders.
