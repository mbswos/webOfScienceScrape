Analyzing a panel of 309 listed Swedish firms during 1991–1997, for which we have complete and detailed data on ownership and corporate control instruments, we provide these results; families employ CMS structures, via dual-class shares and other corporate control instruments, about 1.5–2 times more often than other categories of owners (corporations, financial institutions). Estimated agency costs of controlling shareholders are 6%–25% of firm value (Tobin\'s <i>q</i>) for the median firm among the different categories of controlling owners, ceteris paribus.

At the same time as this issue was being debated in the United States, Sweden was in the process of launching a system that is very similar to President Bush’s proposal. Although Bush’s plan did not get much attention in the early years of his administration, the proposal may resurface either in the United States or in other countries. If so, important lessons can be learned from the Swedish experience.

Higher quantities of advertising do not signal ex ante higher unobservable fund manager ability, because funds that advertise more are not associated with higher post-advertising excess returns. Fund advertising is shown to affect investors\' choices, although it provides little information. These results do not seem to be driven by the endogeneity of advertising, and are robust to a series of robustness checks. Finally, advertising is found to steer people towards portfolios with higher fees and more risk, through higher exposure to equities, more active management, more" hot" sectors, and more home bias.

Second, when investors are shown past negative stock price paths in red, expectations about future stock returns are reduced. Consistent with red causing “avoidance behavior,” red color reduces investors’ propensity to purchase stocks. The findings are robust to a series of checks involving colorblind investors and alternative colors to control for salience effects. Finally, the effects are muted in a cultural setting, eg, China, where red is not used to visualize financial losses.

Because we control for an extensive set of individual characteristics analyzed in existing research, an interpretation of our …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Henrik Cronqvist and Florian Münkel and Stephan Siegel', 'eprint': 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11146-012-9373-0', 'journal': 'Journal of Real Estate Finance and Economics', 'pages': '79-111', 'publisher': 'Springer Netherlands', 'title': 'Genetics, homeownership, and home location choice', 'url': 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11146-012-9373-0', 'volume': '48', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 17, 'id_citations': 'hbNGOGYAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '5646127446480704190', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"> <div class="gsh_csp">To inform economists and policymakers about whether the effects of nudges are persistent in one specific context, we study the choice architecture of the Swedish Premium Pension Plan. The data we study consist of all initial choices and subsequent rebalancing activities by the entire population of 7.3 million retirement savers in Sweden during the period 2000 to 2016. Based on our analysis of these data, we conclude that the effects of nudging in this case were surprisingly persistent and seem to last nearly two decades, if not forever.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Henrik Cronqvist and Richard H Thaler and Frank Yu', 'eprint': 'https://media.top1000funds.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/27151411/When-nudges-are-forever-inertia-in-the-Swedish-pension-system.pdf', 'journal': 'AEA Papers & Proceedings', 'pages': '153-158', 'title': 'When nudges are forever: Inertia in the Swedish Premium Pension Plan', 'url': 'https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pandp.20181096', 'volume': '108', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 13, 'id_citations': 'hbNGOGYAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '16025123578018976327', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">We study the effects of the creation of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on corporate governance. Established in 1934, the SEC effectively applied the listing standards of the NYSE to all regional stock exchanges in the US We therefore examine the impact of the SEC by comparing non-NYSE listing firms before and after the landmark legislation was adopted, using the NYSE as a control group. Our estimates reveal that there was a 30% reduction in board independence, ie, the creation of the SEC caused boards to become significantly less independent. We find no corresponding effects on firm valuations. Our evidence is consistent with a" substitution of governance mechanisms" hypothesis, ie, firms endogenously trade off market-based (board) governance and government-sponsored (SEC) governance. This evidence has implications for corporate governance regulation around the world.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Arevik Avedian and Henrik Cronqvist and Marc Weidenmier', 'eprint': 'http://www.academia.edu/download/41663646/SSRN-id2498007.pdf', 'journal': 'Available at SSRN 2498007', 'title': 'Corporate governance and the creation of the SEC', 'url': 'https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2498007', 'year': 2014}, 'citedby': 6, 'id_citations': 'hbNGOGYAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '5221662083126222246', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Traditional finance explains individual investors’ behavior and financial decision-making based on economic incentives and rationality. Modern finance, however, takes a holistic view and searches for not only economic but also biological, psychological, and social factors that shape decision-making and investor behavior. In this new approach, genetics, life experiences, psychological traits, social norms, peer influences, as well as her beliefs, values and culture in general determine stock market participation decision, share of equity holding, frequency of trading, extent of diversification, and preferences for investment styles of an individual investor. The collective preferences and actions of individual investors exert an impact on asset pricing and corporate decisions.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Henrik Cronqvist and Danling Jiang', 'title': 'Individual investors', 'url': 'https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2972679', 'year': 2017}, 'citedby': 4, 'id_citations': 'hbNGOGYAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '16392657443340085863', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'author': 'Henrik Cronqvist and Tomislav Ladika and Zacharias Sautner', 'title': "Limited Attention to Detail: How Analysts' Valuations Change Following Mandatory Option Expensing", 'year': 2018}, 'id_citations': 'hbNGOGYAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC', 'source': 'citations'}]
