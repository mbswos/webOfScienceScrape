A Kalman filter estimation procedure that allows for a time‐dependent number of daily observations is used to calibrate the model. When applied to all daily oil futures price transactions from 1992 to 2001, the model performs very well, requiring at least three factors to explain the term structure of futures prices, but four factors to fit the volatility term structure. The model also performs very well for daily copper futures transactions from 1992 to 2001 and for out‐of‐sample daily oil futures transactions from 2002 to 2004. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Yet, they behave differently, especially in periods of economic stress. Derivatives markets offer a unique laboratory to extract a short-term borrowing and lending rate available to all investors that is relatively free from liquidity and credit effects. Interestingly, implied interest rates do not resemble benchmark interest rates such as the three-month T-bill rate or LIBOR, but instead are much more volatile. I argue that the volatility in the implied short-term rate in futures and option markets is due to frictions arising from borrowing and short-selling costs. I derive an equilibrium model of the futures market where demand imbalances from traders affect the implied interest rate. In the model, the implied interest rate depends on the" true" risk-free rate and a latent demand factor. I estimate the model based on S&amp;P 500 index futures using the Kalman filter. The risk-free rate that results from this estimation has time-series properties similar to Treasury and LIBOR rates, and anticipates interest rate changes. The spread between the risk-free and the T-bill rate correlates with liquidity proxies of the Treasury market, while the spread between LIBOR and the risk-free rate is related to economic distress. The latent demand factor is closely related to proxies for demand pressure in the futures market, such as large speculator positions as well as investor sentiment. The demand factor is positive (negative) when buying (selling) pressure is high and is difficult to borrow (to short-sell the underlying). I also find that demand imbalances are correlated across different indexes, for both futures …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Lorenzo Naranjo', 'eprint': 'http://people.stern.nyu.edu/lnaranjo/implied_rates.pdf', 'title': 'Implied interest rates in a market with frictions', 'url': 'https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1308908', 'year': 2009}, 'citedby': 19, 'id_citations': 'xs05Zi0AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '14814592729459829654', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">This paper investigates the determinants of credit risk in insurance companies in the US and Europe. Consistent with recent results for non-financial firms in the US, we find that equity volatility is a major determinant and predictor of CDS spreads for both US and European insurers, even after controlling for the composition of their investment portfolios and other firm-specific characteristics such as leverage and macro controls. Furthermore, we find macroeconomic factors to affect the credit risk of European but not US insurers, whereas cash holdings seem to be relevant in explaining the credit spreads of US insurance companies. We find that cash holdings and credit spreads of US insurers are positively correlated. However, the availability of cash reduces the credit risk of firms experiencing positive solvency shocks. Overall, our results are economically significant and suggest that equity and credit markets incorporate quickly relevant information on the creditworthiness of large insurers.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Liliana Gonzalez and Lorenzo Naranjo', 'eprint': 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.651.3151&rep=rep1&type=pdf', 'journal': 'Available at SSRN 2325457', 'title': 'Credit risk determinants of insurance companies', 'url': 'https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2325457', 'year': 2014}, 'citedby': 3, 'id_citations': 'xs05Zi0AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '10292227702339835668', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">We propose a novel, fast, accurate parallel algorithm for pricing American options.

First, speculators behave like short term momentum traders and long-term contrarians. Their imbalances are positively autocorrelated and positively cross-autocorrelated with small investor imbalances, consistent with their ‘riding the wave’caused by small traders. Speculators sell (buy) to a greater extent after their long (short) positions have become larger, especially when volatility is elevated: this is consistent with their being risk averse. Small trader imbalances also follow speculator imbalances of a given sign, and display mean reversion and volatility aversion, but both are weaker than for speculators. Second, imbalances have positive and significant permanent price effects, which are larger for speculators. Further analysis suggests that the price impact of speculator imbalances is smaller when they act as suppliers of liquidity to hedgers. Finally, price volatility is related positively to lagged small trader imbalances, supportive of noise trader effects, and negatively to the lagged variability of speculator imbalances, which is inconsistent with speculator activity promoting futures market volatility. Our results are broadly similar in extreme market conditions. The picture that emerges from our analysis is that speculators are risk averse, short-term oriented, liquidity providers with trades that are, in general, not destabilizing. Our work contributes to the debate on the effects of trading, especially by speculators, and the need for new regulatory initiatives.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Aditya Kaul and Lorenzo Naranjo and Carmen Stefanescu', 'journal': '26th Australasian Finance and Banking Conference', 'title': 'The Dynamics of Trading in Commodity Futures', 'url': 'https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2311859', 'year': 2013}, 'id_citations': 'xs05Zi0AAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">The first essay examines theoretically and empirically how borrowing and shortselling costs affect the pricing of derivatives contracts.
