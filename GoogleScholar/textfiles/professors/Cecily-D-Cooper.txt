Since then, research on this topic has continued to accelerate, and many new scientists have entered the field. Our knowledge base and relevant new technologies have also been expanding. Accordingly, it is important to update these guidelines for monitoring autophagy in different organisms. Various reviews have described the range of assays that have been used for this purpose. Nevertheless, there continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to measure autophagy, especially in multicellular eukaryotes. A key point that needs to be emphasized is that there is a difference between measurements that monitor the numbers or volume of autophagic elements (e.g., autophagosomes or autolysosomes) at any stage of the autophagic process vs. those that measure flux through the autophagy pathway (i.e., the …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Daniel J Klionsky and Fabio C Abdalla and Hagai Abeliovich and Robert T Abraham and Abraham Acevedo-Arozena and Khosrow Adeli and Lotta Agholme and Maria Agnello and Patrizia Agostinis and Julio A Aguirre-Ghiso and Hyung Jun Ahn and Ouardia Ait-Mohamed and Slimane Ait-Si-Ali and Takahiko Akematsu and Shizuo Akira and Hesham M Al-Younes and Munir A Al-Zeer and Matthew L Albert and Roger L Albin and Javier Alegre-Abarrategui and Maria Francesca Aleo and Mehrdad Alirezaei and Alexandru Almasan and Maylin Almonte-Becerril and Atsuo Amano and Ravi K Amaravadi and Shoba Amarnath and Amal O Amer and Nathalie Andrieu-Abadie and Vellareddy Anantharam and David K Ann and Shailendra Anoopkumar-Dukie and Hiroshi Aoki and Nadezda Apostolova and Giuseppe Arancia and John P Aris and Katsuhiko Asanuma and Nana YO Asare and Hisashi Ashida and Valerie Askanas and David S Askew and Patrick Auberger and Misuzu Baba and Steven K Backues and Eric H Baehrecke and Ben A Bahr and Xue-Yuan Bai and Yannick Bailly and Robert Baiocchi and Giulia Baldini and Walter Balduini and Andrea Ballabio and Bruce A Bamber and Edward TW Bampton and Gábor Juhász and Clinton R Bartholomew and Diane C Bassham and Robert C Bast and Henri Batoko and Boon-Huat Bay and Isabelle Beau and Daniel M Béchet and Thomas J Begley and Christian Behl and Christian Behrends and Soumeya Bekri and Bryan Bellaire and Linda J Bendall and Luca Benetti and Laura Berliocchi and Henri Bernardi and Francesca Bernassola and Sébastien Besteiro and Ingrid Bhatia-Kissova and Xiaoning Bi and Martine Biard-Piechaczyk and Janice S Blum and Lawrence H Boise and Paolo Bonaldo and David L Boone and Beat C Bornhauser and Karina R Bortoluci and Ioannis Bossis and Frédéric Bost and Jean-Pierre Bourquin and Patricia Boya and Michaël Boyer-Guittaut and Peter V Bozhkov and Nathan R Brady and Claudio Brancolini and Andreas Brech and Jay E Brenman and Ana Brennand and Emery H Bresnick and Patrick Brest and Dave Bridges and Molly L Bristol and Paul S Brookes and Eric J Brown and John H Brumell and Nicola Brunetti-Pierri and Ulf T Brunk and Dennis E Bulman and Scott J Bultman and Geert Bultynck and Lena F Burbulla and Wilfried Bursch and Jonathan P Butchar and Wanda Buzgariu and Sergio P Bydlowski and Ken Cadwell and Monika Cahová and Dongsheng Cai and Jiyang Cai and Qian Cai and Bruno Calabretta and Javier Calvo-Garrido and Nadine Camougrand and Michelangelo Campanella and Jenny Campos-Salinas and Eleonora Candi and Lizhi Cao and Allan B Caplan and Simon R Carding and Sandra M Cardoso and Jennifer S Carew and Cathleen R Carlin and Virginie Carmignac and Leticia AM Carneiro and Serena Carra and Rosario A Caruso and Giorgio Casari and Caty Casas and Roberta Castino and Eduardo Cebollero and Francesco Cecconi and Jean Celli and Hassan Chaachouay and Han-Jung Chae and Chee-Yin Chai and David C Chan and Edmond Y Chan and Raymond Chuen-Chung Chang and Chi-Ming Che and Ching-Chow Chen and Guang-Chao Chen and Guo-Qiang Chen and Min Chen and Quan Chen and Steve S-L Chen', 'eprint': 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.4161/auto.19496', 'number': '4', 'pages': '445-544', 'publisher': 'Taylor & Francis', 'title': 'Guidelines for the use and interpretation of assays for monitoring autophagy', 'url': 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.4161/auto.19496', 'volume': '8', 'year': 2012}, 'citedby': 5164, 'id_citations': 'pp-gPWAAAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '5775822219693224114', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Two studies were conducted to examine the implications of an apology versus a denial for repairing trust after an alleged violation.

In the initial, inductive phase I conducted semi-structured interviews using general questions regarding the interpersonal dynamics of humor at work to identify the humor-related issue most relevant to respondents. Subjects from a variety of job types and organizations indicated that the use of humor by managers was a particularly important issue and could have a definite positive or negative impact on subordinates.

Leader-triggered positive emotion and subsequent social exchange, operationalized as leader–member exchange (LMX), functioned as key sequential mechanisms mediating the relationship between LH and subordinate OCBs.

The general research question that we will address is, “What are the consequences of perceptual distance for team process and outcomes?” Our basic argument is that the relationship between perceptual distance and team processes and outcomes is moderated by two key cultural characteristics: power distance and collectivism. For example, depending upon the dynamics of power distance, large differences in perceptions of a team leader\'s behavior can negatively impact team productivity.

Humorous leaders also engender positive employee attitudes and are viewed as more effective overall by those they oversee (Priest &amp; Swain, 2002). This small but burgeoning area of research has been summarized in a number of literature reviews (Cooper &amp; Sosik, 2012; Duncan, Smeltzer, &amp; Leap, 1990; Romero &amp; Cruthirds, 2006) and some theoretical articles (Cooper, 2005, 2008; Robert &amp; Wilbanks, 2012).

However, subordinates also form global appraisals of their managers across specific events and situations. To augment the event paradigm, research falling within the “social entity paradigm” focuses on these general justice appraisals. To date, very little theory has been developed on managerial fairness from a social entity perspective. Little is known regarding how entity perceptions are formed (i.e., how managers come to be seen as “fair managers”).

Existing empirical research on trust repair has focused primarily on interpersonal trust, resulting in a body of knowledge that provides many insights to the errant CEO but few insights for those who aim to repair trust in the organisation. Since organisations also need to regain the trust of stakeholders after a CEO transgression, research on organisational trust repair is clearly warranted. Organisations have options for trust repair that are not available to individuals (e.g. dismissing the transgressor), these actions may be initiated by parties other than the culpable party (e.g. the Board of Directors), and the mechanisms underlying organisational versus interpersonal trust repair may differ.

We recognize another form of verbal response: reticence. Although reticence is sometimes used for strategic reasons (eg, to unjustifiably evade culpability), reticence is also used in many situations because it is more appropriate than apology and denial. By considering information diagnosticity and belief formation mechanisms through which verbal responses are evaluated, we hypothesized that the effectiveness of reticence vis-à-vis apology and denial depends on the nature of the original trust violation. The hypotheses were tested in a laboratory study of a simulated employment interview. Results indicate that, as a response to an integrity-based violation, reticence produces trust levels that are similar to those of apology but inferior to denial. As a response to a competence-based violation, reticence produces trust levels that are similar to those of denial but inferior to apology. Our results have important implications for those who might use reticence to respond to a perceived trust violation, and also for those who must judge another\'s reticence.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Donald L FERRIN and Peter H Kim and Cecily D Cooper and Kurt T Dirks', 'pages': 'C1', 'publisher': 'Academy of Management', 'title': 'Silence Speaks Volumes: The Effectiveness of Reticence for Repairing Trust Violations', 'url': 'http://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/lkcsb_research/2527/', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'pp-gPWAAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'author': 'Peter H Kim and Kurk T Dirks and Cecily D Cooper and Donald L FERRIN', 'title': 'The Effects of Internal and External Attributions on Trust Repair', 'url': 'http://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/lkcsb_research/2579/', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'pp-gPWAAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'author': 'Kurt T DIRKS and Peter H KIM and Cecily D Cooper and Donald L FERRIN', 'title': 'Trust under Repair: Regulation and Punishment as Methods for Rebuilding Trust', 'url': 'https://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/lkcsb_research/2513/', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'pp-gPWAAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">The justice literature has unequivocally noted how important it is employees feel they are treated fairly. Accordingly, managers often find themselves in predicaments of injustice which they must resolve. Research on social accounts describes strategies managers can use to make themselves “seem fair,” thus, alleviating their predicament. But in taking an impression management perspective of justice, this literature fails to acknowledge that many managers actually want to “be fair.” Based on the latter assumption, we propose an alternative framework for understanding how managers will address justice-related predicaments.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'A Terri and Cecily D Cooper', 'eprint': 'http://scholarlyrepository.miami.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1007&context=management_articles', 'title': "Looks Aren't Everything: Aren't Managers Concerned with Actually Being Fair", 'url': 'http://scholarlyrepository.miami.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1007&context=management_articles', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'pp-gPWAAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">DT Kong, L.

By considering theory regarding differences in the perceived diagnosticity of information about competence versus integrity, we note that the conditions where external attributions would be more necessary for mitigating one’s blame are precisely the conditions where such external attributions are less likely to be believed. Moreover, empirical studies that have compared the relative benefits of external and internal attributions for repairing trust have reached conflicting conclusions regarding the response that should be used.
