The authors argue that this is due to differences in causal attributions for positive versus negative information such that positive reviews tend to be relatively more attributed to the reviewer (vs. product experience) than negative reviews. The presence of temporal contiguity cues, which indicate that review writing closely follows consumption, reduces the relative extent to which positive reviews are attributed to the reviewer and mitigates the negativity bias. An examination of 65,531 Yelp.com restaurant reviews shows that review value is negatively related to review valence but that this negative relationship is absent for reviews that contain temporal contiguity cues. A series of lab studies replicates these findings and suggests that temporal contiguity cues enhance the value of a positive review and increase the likelihood of …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Zoey Chen and Nicholas H Lurie', 'eprint': 'https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1509/jmr.12.0063', 'journal': 'Journal of Marketing Research', 'number': '4', 'pages': '463-476', 'publisher': 'SAGE Publications', 'title': 'Temporal contiguity and negativity bias in the impact of online word of mouth', 'url': 'https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmr.12.0063', 'volume': '50', 'year': 2013}, 'citedby': 228, 'id_citations': 'RaqYqeQAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '7924215695880969795', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"> <div class="gsh_csp">How does controversy affect conversation? Five studies using both field and laboratory data address this question. Contrary to popular belief, controversial things are not necessarily more likely to be discussed. Controversy increases likelihood of discussion at low levels, but beyond a moderate level of controversy, additional controversy actually decreases likelihood of discussion. The controversy-conversation relationship is driven by two countervailing processes. Controversy increases interest (which increases likelihood of discussion) but simultaneously increases discomfort (which decreases likelihood of discussion). Contextual factors such as anonymity and whether people are talking to friends or strangers moderate the controversy-conversation relationship by impacting these component processes. Our framework sheds light on how, when, and why controversy affects whether or not things are discussed.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Zoey Chen and Jonah Berger', 'eprint': 'https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-pdf/40/3/580/7939483/40-3-580.pdf', 'journal': 'Journal of Consumer Research', 'number': '3', 'pages': '580-593', 'publisher': 'University of Chicago Press', 'title': 'When, why, and how controversy causes conversation', 'url': 'https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/40/3/580/2379779', 'volume': '40', 'year': 2013}, 'citedby': 109, 'id_citations': 'RaqYqeQAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C', 'id_scholarcitedby': '10421058192889867788', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"> <div class="gsh_csp">People often share word of mouth with others, and such social sharing is an integral part of everyday life. But the content (e.g., stories, news, information) that people transmit can be acquired in different ways. Sometimes people <i>find</i> content themselves, and other times people <i>receive</i> content from others (e.g., via email or conversation). Might these different acquisition methods impact subsequent sharing, and if so, how? Six studies demonstrate that acquisition method can impact transmission through changing how content is processed. Compared to received content, people are more likely to associate found content with themselves, which decreases processing. Reduced processing, in turn, lowers sensitivity to diagnostic content characteristics (e.g., whether content is interesting or well written), which reduces these characteristics’ impact on sharing. Thus while receivers are more likely to share interesting …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Zoey Chen and Jonah Berger', 'eprint': 'https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-pdf/43/1/86/17744633/ucw001.pdf', 'journal': 'Journal of Consumer Research', 'number': '1', 'pages': '86-102', 'publisher': 'Oxford University Press', 'title': 'How content acquisition method affects word of mouth', 'url': 'https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/43/1/86/2379577', 'volume': '43', 'year': 2016}, 'citedby': 22, 'id_citations': 'RaqYqeQAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '8180768434651783589', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"> <div class="gsh_csp">Consumers are increasingly sharing product experiences with strangers and friends online.

The current article theorizes that one important motivation for WOM is social acceptance. To fulfill this motivation, people form and maintain existing relationships with others. Building on research in interpersonal relationships, we theorize that when communicating with strangers, people attempt to self-enhance to attract strangers into <i>forming</i> relationships with the self; when sharing with friends, on the other hand, people attempt to connect emotionally in order to <i>maintain</i> existing ties.

Further, we propose that accounting for distinguishing aspects of mobile ecosystems, the context in which mobile ecosystems are used, and interactions between mobile ecosystems and mobile contexts are critical in advancing theoretical and substantive understanding of the role of mobile technologies in the marketplace.

In this session, we define advocacy as either:(A) sharing or expressing one’s opinion about an issue or product, or (B) making an explicit effort to persuade others toward one’s opinion about an issue or product. Across four papers, we attempt to answer when, why, and how people choose to share their opinions, make recommendations, or persuade others, and we explore how those exposed to such advocacies react in a variety of contexts.</div><div class="gsh_csp">The current session will provide insight into the fundamental drivers of consumer advocacy and the myriad ways in which consumers respond to information sharing and persuasion attempts. Chen and Berger focus on sharing and word of mouth. They find important differences in the effects of receiving content from others versus finding it themselves: When people receive content from others, they share interesting but not boring content; however, when they find the content themselves, they do not discriminate and end up sharing both interesting and boring content. Moore, López, and De Maya focus primarily on how learning others’ opinions influences consumers’ product evaluations. Specifically, they investigate when and why consumers are influenced by others’ opinions. They show that exposure to others’ opinions impacts subsequent evaluations and purchase intentions of products, even when a participant has direct experience with the product …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Zoey Chen and Jonah Berger', 'eprint': 'http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/v43/acr_vol43_1019093.pdf', 'journal': 'ACR North American Advances', 'title': 'Finding Vs.

While it’s clear that word of mouth shapes consumer behavior (Chevalier and Mayzlin 2006; Chintagunta et al. 2013), and some work has begun to uncover behavioral drivers of word of mouth (Berger 2014), there has been less attention to the underlying role of language in these processes (cf.

A combination of field data and laboratory experiments show that novices tend to use stronger, more persuasive,“I recommend” endorsements than expert consumers. This, in turn, leads word of mouth recipients to follow objectively inferior recommendations. While paying for online reviews might seem like a good idea, du Plessis and Dubois demonstrate that it actually undermines review persuasiveness. Two experiments show that the language used in paid (vs. unpaid) reviews produces heightened recipient perceptions that the sender is uncertain about their attitudes, increasing recipients’ own doubt of the product’s quality and decreasing their purchase intentions. A subsequent study demonstrates that incentive size moderates the effect and that paying senders a small (versus no or …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Zoey Chen and Ann Schlosser', 'eprint': 'http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/v43/acr_vol43_1020027.pdf', 'journal': 'ACR North American Advances', 'title': 'Transmitting Well-Reasoned Word of Mouth Impairs Memory For Product Experiences', 'url': 'http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/v43/acr_vol43_1020027.pdf', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'RaqYqeQAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Consumer researchers now have access to a variety of data sources (eg, Facebook status updates, online reviews, and blogs).
