Environmental regulation in the US began in the late 1950s as legislation was passed at the federal, state, and local levels to decrease the nation\'s water and air pollution. During the following decade, significant environmental legislation was enacted in response to public demands. All prospective purchasers and successors in interest, such as foreclosing creditors, must evaluate carefully the potential environmental liabilities of each parcel of property they plan to acquire since they may be held financially and legally responsible for future problems.

Dentsply International, Inc. However, indirect purchasers from these marketers, who may be injured by what was found to be fundamentally monopolistic behavior, were left unprotected. Clearly, creating the type of contractual relationships that Dentsply developed is very dangerous, particularly when the firm is in a dominant market position. Even under their current noninterventionist antitrust policy, seeking and achieving a monopoly through predatory exclusive-dealing and pricing agreements will not be …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'René Sacasas', 'eprint': 'http://search.proquest.com/openview/d6584ad233286cc70aa971c07854d0f2/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=7397', 'journal': 'Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science', 'number': '4', 'pages': '629', 'publisher': 'Springer Science & Business Media', 'title': 'Channels of Distribution Issues Under the Antitrust Statutes', 'url': 'http://search.proquest.com/openview/d6584ad233286cc70aa971c07854d0f2/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=7397', 'volume': '34', 'year': 2006}, 'id_citations': 'CLxGmigAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr">Skip to main content.

When an audit of Maislin Industries Inc. revealed undercharges for services provided to Primary Steel Inc., Maislin\'s bankruptcy trustees billed Primary Steel for the difference. Primary Steel refused to pay, and Maislin\'s trustees filed a lawsuit.

However, only recently has this dynamic relationship between environmental changes and strategic shifts received attention in the literature. 2 This paper focuses on the effects of a major environmental change, deregulation, on the LTL (less-than-truckload) motor carrier strategies. The passage of the Motor Carrier Act (MCA) of 1980 was an especially traumatic event, in particular for the LTL segment of the motor carrier industry. This segment had received the greatest benefits from the protective system of government regulation initiated in 1935 with the inclusion by Congress of motor carriers under the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). 3 The government-sanctioned rate bureaus, coupled with highly restrictive ICC entry policies, resulted in an absence of effective rate competition among LTL carriers.

Managers often make such decisions because they feel the pressure to save on short-term costs. The current corporate culture fosters bad decisions by encouraging managers to maximize short-term profits and discouraging the long-term analysis of legal and ethical implications. Enabling a front-line manager to make more ethical decisions requires a change at both the individual and organizational levels. If the corporation sees itself as a social, rather than a purely economic, entity, then responsible decision making will be tied to factors other than quarterly financial reports. Management then may need to act on nonmarket moral duties. At this point, training in ethical analysis becomes critical for providing employees with a framework for long-term decision …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Rene Sacasas and Anita Cava', 'eprint': 'http://search.proquest.com/openview/6cb8edf170b5590e11d356376b315295/1.pdf?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=48428', 'journal': 'Business Forum', 'title': 'Law, Ethics and Management: Toward an Effective Audit ‘', 'url': 'http://search.proquest.com/openview/6cb8edf170b5590e11d356376b315295/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=48428', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'CLxGmigAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Rene Sacasas orporate executives c and their lawyers have a relationship which has been described as an uneasy truce.

The legal question surrounding these agreements is whether they contain an enforceable promise. Case law reveals that the letter writer escapes the traditional guarantee promises by refusing to write the" magic" words that bind it. One financial institute classified these letters as Grade A, B, or C, depending on the promises involved. According to a review of case law, comfort letters have commercial significance. Many courts are ruling that, in some cases, these letters do contain binding promises similar to traditional guarantees, and, therefore, may be considered a loss contingency. When comfort letters have been issued, the auditor\'s primary concern is failing to discover a material contingent liability not disclosed in the financial statements and, thus, being associated …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Rene Sacasas and Kay Tatum and Don Wiesner', 'eprint': 'http://search.proquest.com/openview/5734b5cc24b47e3d8e646a05ef27ec73/1.pdf?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=41798', 'journal': 'The CPA Journal', 'number': '11', 'pages': '46', 'publisher': 'New York State Society of Certified Public Accountants', 'title': 'Keep-Well Letters: The Elusive Contingency', 'url': 'http://search.proquest.com/openview/5734b5cc24b47e3d8e646a05ef27ec73/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=41798', 'volume': '59', 'year': 1989}, 'id_citations': 'CLxGmigAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC', 'source': 'citations'}]
