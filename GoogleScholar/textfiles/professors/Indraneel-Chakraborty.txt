Our algorithm allows nodes to synchronize to sources of real time such as GPS when such signals are available, but continues to synchronize nodes to each other, even in the absence of GPS. In addition, the algorithm satisfies a relaxed gradient property, in which the degree of synchronization between nodes varies as a linear function of their distance.

After fundraising is complete, write-offs double and reinvestments in relatively worse-off entrepreneurial firms increase. We find that these observations cannot be explained by strategic bundling of news or effort constraints due to the newly raised fund. Funds with both long and short fundraising track record exhibit this behavior and the delay is costly for fund investors (LPs).

We model this relationship and calibrate the model to observed data. The model yields empirical predictions regarding the impact of a fund’s distance from the high water mark (HWM) on effort, risk and walkaway behavior. Testing the model on empirical data, we find that as funds fall from the HWM, future expected returns fall, the incidence of fund closure increases and the variance of future returns increases. All of these effects are most stark for funds closer to the HWM and are milder for funds further away. Additionally, we find that risks taken by funds further below their HWMs tend to generate lower expected returns than those closer to their HWMs. In addition to being consistent with predictions from our model, these results resonate well with the economic intuition that such contracts function as if fund managers hold call options with varying degrees of moneyness (depending on distance from the HWM) on the return stream to the investor’s funds. Finally, using the calibrated model, we consider welfare implications of changes to the 2/20 contract.

It has been recognized that such a penalty can lead to conservative bidding by the renewable generator, which may lead to lower than desired penetration of renewable energy in the …</div></div>', 'author': 'Nayara Aguiar and Vijay Gupta and Pramod P Khargonekar and Indraneel Chakraborty', 'eprint': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel7/8410068/8430677/08431253.pdf', 'pages': '6176-6181', 'publisher': 'IEEE', 'title': 'Bilateral contracts between ngpps and renewable plants can increase penetration of renewables', 'url': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8431253/', 'year': 2018}, 'citedby': 2, 'id_citations': 'EWJBMF8AAAAJ:2ywjKiB__4kC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '13539444048363152442', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Supply-side frictions impact corporate debt maturity choices. Similar to bank loan markets, corporate debt markets exhibit repeated issuance relationships between underwriters and issuers. Using micro-level data on investor-underwriter-issuer relationships, we uncover significant frictions in the US public corporate debt markets, even though firms issuing corporate debt often have relatively easier access to capital. Firm debt maturity is more sensitive to underwriter preferences than to a firm’s past debt maturity. Firm issuance amounts decrease with an increase in the maturity preference mismatch between firms and underwriters. Supply-side frictions in the corporate debt market lead to slower lending and firm asset growth.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Indraneel Chakraborty and Andrew MacKinlay', 'journal': 'University of Miami Business School Research Paper', 'number': '18-11', 'title': 'The Effects of Financing Frictions in Investment-Grade Debt Markets', 'url': 'https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3069076', 'year': 2019}, 'citedby': 1, 'id_citations': 'EWJBMF8AAAAJ:27LrP4qxOz0C', 'id_scholarcitedby': '1808368052424675208', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">We show that a platform-pays mechanism can address ratings inflation and ratings shopping with minimum regulatory oversight. While we focus on ratings industry, the mechanism also applies to a setting where firms seek unbiased reports from external auditors. The mechanism has two necessary and sufficient features: strategic delegation and outcome-contingent contracts. First, an issuer strategically delegates the task to acquire ratings from credit ratings agencies (CRAs) to a pass-through non-monitoring platform (the" trust"). The trust operates as a commitment mechanism, assuring investors that issuers did not shop for ratings. Second, the ex-ante determined publicly available fees schedule is partially outcome-contingent, allowing most of the fees to be paid upfront. We provide the contractual space of fees that support the unbiased ratings equilibrium. A contract calibrated to data shows that the cost of implementation of such a mechanism is small. Results encourage policymakers to undertake reforms.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Indraneel Chakraborty and Alessio Saretto and Malcolm Wardlaw', 'eprint': 'http://moya.bus.miami.edu/~ichakraborty/papers/trustalternative.pdf', 'journal': 'Available at SSRN 2489471', 'title': 'Can a Platform-Pays Mechanism Reduce Credit Ratings Bias?', 'url': 'https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2489471', 'year': 2019}, 'citedby': 1, 'id_citations': 'EWJBMF8AAAAJ:wE-fMHVdjMkC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '3310917169450007977', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">This paper studies Reverse Asset Substitution (RAS), an agency problem in which banks place investment and borrowing restrictions on firms as part of a strategy to extract surplus from the firms over multiple periods. RAS arises for firms that cannot access public debt markets due to agency problems and cannot commit to a lending bank for a long relationship. RAS provides a constrained optimal lending solution to ensure banks can lend to firms despite this limited commitment problem. Under RAS, the restrictions imposed by banks commit the firms to having a prolonged lending relationship. RAS reduces a firm’s investment and leverage compared to the case in which firms can commit to a lending relationship with the bank.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Franklin Allen and Indraneel Chakraborty', 'eprint': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Indraneel_Chakraborty/publication/228172098_A_Theory_of_Reverse_Asset_Substitution/links/59f1de9ca6fdcc1dc7bb0591/A-Theory-of-Reverse-Asset-Substitution.pdf', 'journal': 'Available at SSRN 1019383', 'title': 'A Theory of Reverse Asset Substitution', 'url': 'https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1019383', 'year': 2012}, 'citedby': 1, 'id_citations': 'EWJBMF8AAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C', 'id_scholarcitedby': '16317854336325398845', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">For forty years, at a large scale, the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) has encouraged US banks to lend to lower income neighborhoods. We estimate costs and benefits of providing incentives to privately-owned banks to reduce poverty. Regarding costs, to comply with CRA, rather than lend more overall, banks perfectly substitute away from small business lending to other income groups. Regarding benefits, 0.5% of the population is lifted out of poverty per year through the CRA small-business lending channel. The incidence of the act is on smaller banks who lend more and face higher loan losses. Large banks show no effects.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Indraneel Chakraborty and Vidhi Chhaochharia and Rong Hai and Prithu Vatsa', 'journal': 'Available at SSRN 3353786', 'title': 'Returns to Community Lending', 'url': 'https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3353786', 'year': 2019}, 'id_citations': 'EWJBMF8AAAAJ:C33y2ycGS3YC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Recent studies and anecdotal evidence suggest that investors struggle to process complex financial reports. Existing theory and evidence demonstrate that banks not only have unique advantages in acquiring information, relative to equity and public debt investors, but also can impose contractual terms to mitigate information frictions. We investigate whether financial statement complexity is associated with firms\' reliance on bank financing and with the terms of bank loans (ie, the amount and rate of the loan, along with covenants and collateral). We focus on two dimensions of complexity that capture the volume and presentation of financial information: 10-K length and readability. We find that complexity is positively associated both with firms\' reliance on bank financing and with banks increasing their level of screening, rationing their credit supply, and imposing tighter covenants. Our results suggest that banks continue to play their role as informed capital providers in a changing economy, characterized by growing financial statement complexity and innovations in banks\' business models.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Indraneel Chakraborty and Andrew J Leone and Miguel Minutti-Meza and Matthew Phillips', 'eprint': 'https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/59247/1/HARC_2019_paper_23.pdf', 'journal': '29th Annual Conference on Financial Economics & Accounting', 'title': 'Financial Statement Complexity and Bank Lending', 'url': 'https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3214576', 'year': 2018}, 'id_citations': 'EWJBMF8AAAAJ:eAlLMO4JVmQC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Most corporate political spending consists of lobbying expenditures and candidate contributions from a firm’s Political Action Committee. We examine how the political spending of industry trade associations and lobbyist’s networks of clients affect a firm’s political strategy. The political expenditures of trade associations are of the same economic importance as the expenditures of corporations, and corporations and their trade associations support the same candidates. The average lobbyist in our sample has more than 40 clients and we find evidence of coordinated political spending across those clients. Firms are more likely to support a candidate if their lobbyist also personally contributes to that candidate. Firms are more likely to support an incumbent candidate that currently serves on a committee that regulates the firm’s industry. However, a firm is also more likely to contribute to a candidate that serves on a committee that is unrelated to its industry if that candidate serves on a committee that regulates another firm in the same lobbying network. Measures of the strength and quality of the lobbyist network are positively correlated with future stock returns even after controlling for the direct political spending of the firm.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Indraneel Chakraborty and Richard Evans and Rüdiger Fahlenbrach', 'eprint': 'https://www.hhs.se/contentassets/4411f30b294445bd8f6b4c772bdddb78/fahlenbrach_lobbying_cef_01apr2015.pdf', 'title': 'Political activity of firms: The role of firm-lobbying networks and industry trade associations', 'url': 'https://www.hhs.se/contentassets/4411f30b294445bd8f6b4c772bdddb78/fahlenbrach_lobbying_cef_01apr2015.pdf'}, 'id_citations': 'EWJBMF8AAAAJ:6_hjMsCP8ZoC', 'source': 'citations'}]
