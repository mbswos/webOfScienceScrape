Tabu search is a meta procedure that requires a subroutine to find local optima. In most examples of tabu search the subroutine used is problem specific. However, in order to apply tabu search successfully to general 0-1 integer programs, the subroutine must be general. The pivot and complement heuristic is a procedure that frequently finds feasible solutions for general 0-1 integer programs. In this paper we implement several elements of strategies proposed by tabu search method that result in general heuristics for 0-1 integer programs that could be included in an integer programming code. These heuristics employ the ZOOM/XMP implementation of the pivot and complement heuristic as a subroutine. Computational results indicate that these heuristics provide good bounds for many problems.</div> <div class="gsh_csp"><i>INFORMS Journal on Computing</i> …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Ronny Aboudi and Kurt Jörnsten', 'eprint': 'http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=08991499&AN=4478729&h=GuxGQiK2aIpp9XY0DoMk%2BAVjwN1%2B6Wy95cYqh7EDT1ytOZYqkpsk5O7%2Bpou5cm3A1RavViWoFVt3SrlVtMxw8A%3D%3D&crl=f', 'journal': 'ORSA Journal on Computing', 'number': '1', 'pages': '82-93', 'publisher': 'INFORMS', 'title': 'Tabu search for general zero-one integer programs using the pivot and complement heuristic', 'url': 'https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.6.1.82', 'volume': '6', 'year': 1994}, 'citedby': 77, 'id_citations': 'r659Al8AAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '6411232909722420838', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Daily tactical planning of the vehicle fleet is critical for a car rental business. In this decision-making process planners have to address the conflicting concerns of field management, namely, assuring adequate vehicle availability to satisfy customer demand while maintaining a high degree of utilization for each car in the fleet; this is achieved by the appropriate fleet deployment among car rental locations. This work was inspired by a series of problems encountered by the decision-makers of a major US car rental company. We first present the formulation of the tactical fleet planning model. Based on its structure, we decompose the model into a fleet deployment model and a transportation model. We develop optimal conditions for both subproblems and then we present a heuristic to reduce the gap from optimality for the complete model.

Given m mutually disjoint subsets of E, R(,1),R(,2),...,R(,m), M is a constrained matching \non G if M is a matching that satisfies the additional restrictions M (INTERSECT) R(,j) = R(,j) or \n0 for j = 1,2,...,m; that is, either all the edges of a set R(,j) are contained in M or R(,j) is disjoint \nfrom M. The study of this problem was motivated by a problem of assigning courses to classrooms \nin a large university … It is shown that the maximum cardinality constrained matching problem \nis computationally difficult in the sense that it is NP-hard. The constrained matching problem \nremains NP-hard even when the graph G is bipartite, when G is a tree, and when (VBAR)R(,j)\n(VBAR) (LESSTHEQ) 2 for j = 1,2,...,m … A special case of the constrained matching … </div>', 'author': 'Ronny Aboudi', 'pages': '0766-0766', 'title': 'A CONSTRAINED MATCHING PROBLEM: A POLYHEDRAL APPROACH (STRONG CUTTING PLANE, COMPLEXITY, SEPARATION, VALID INEQUALITIES).', 'url': 'https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=7476705', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 2, 'id_citations': 'r659Al8AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '2574299749620869436', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">There is an irreductible conflict between, on the one hand, the desire to allocate income in society in an equitable way and, on the other, the desire to alleviate poverty.

In this context, evaluating the impact of regional development policies is an important concern, and this provided the motivation for the development of mathematical models and solutions techniques that are presented in this manuscript.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Ronny Aboudi and Paulo Bárcia and Rui Sousa Monteiro', 'publisher': 'Universidade Nova de Lisboa', 'title': 'Clustering with Geographic Contiguity', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11187493751072827625&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'r659Al8AAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">This paper, which is based on the Omega Rho lecture given at the 1990 ORSA/TIMS meeting in Philadelphia, states the author\'s necessary and sufficient conditions for effective OR/MS.

But when I went to Japan for the first time I saw a map of the world with Japan in the middle. Three months later a speaker at a manufacturing conference in Birmingham, England, showed a map of the world with England in the middle.
