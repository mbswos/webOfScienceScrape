The basic aim is to guide design and presentation of products to optimize them to be as compatible as possible with consumer preferences. This paper investigates physiological decision processes while participants undertook a choice task designed to elicit preferences for a product. The task required participants to choose their preferred crackers described by shape (square, triangle, round), flavor (wheat, dark rye, plain) and topping (salt, poppy, no topping). The two main research objectives were (1) to observe and evaluate the cortical activity of the different brain regions and the interdependencies among the Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals from these regions; and (2) unlike most research in this area that has focused mainly on liking/disliking …</div></div></div></div></div>', 'author': 'Rami N Khushaba and Chelsea Wise and Sarath Kodagoda and Jordan Louviere and Barbara E Kahn and Claudia Townsend', 'eprint': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417412013371', 'journal': 'Expert Systems with Applications', 'number': '9', 'pages': '3803-3812', 'publisher': 'Pergamon', 'title': 'Consumer neuroscience: Assessing the brain response to marketing stimuli using electroencephalogram (EEG) and eye tracking', 'url': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417412013371', 'volume': '40', 'year': 2013}, 'citedby': 238, 'id_citations': 'fnoJeaMAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '4132461961011760299', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"> <div class="gsh_csp">The “visual preference heuristic” suggests that consumers prefer visual to verbal depiction of information in a product assortment.

Although planning tends to aid subsequent self-control for those who are in good standing with respect to their long-term goal, those who perceive themselves to be in poor goal standing are found to exert less self-control after planning than in the absence of planning. This occurs because considering a concrete plan for goal implementation creates emotional distress for those in poor goal standing, thereby undermining their motivation for self-regulation.

Yet product choice not only reflects an actual or desired image of the self but can also directly influence a person’s sense of self and even boost self-esteem. The aesthetics of a product is an attribute that has the power to transform how consumers perceive themselves. The mere act of choosing a beautiful product over a less good-looking one affirms people’s sense of self-who they are and what their values are. It goes beyond personal image building and self-presentation; its impact is also turned inwards. Choice of high design works as a unique form of affirmation.

By consuming certain clothing and accessories, consumers can signal status and capitalize on the symbolic nature of goods. The research presented in this session offers a more nuanced and deeper understanding of how, when, and why certain brands and products act as signals, both to the public and to the consumer himself. Each of these projects takes a different perspective in examining the complex consumption choices involved in signaling status. Specifically, two of the projects consider the signals that consumers unknowingly communicate to themselves via the purchase and display of luxury and vintage products. The third and the fourth paper are rooted in consumers’ motivation to signal status to others, via vintage products, and illustrate one manner in which lifestyle brands garner their high price premium. Together these four projects reveal the deep and complex relationship that exists between consumers and the brands and products they purchase.</div><div class="gsh_csp">These papers build on our existing knowledge of how consumers signal social status with the products they consume and display and how these purchases enable consumers to signal important aspects of self.

This began to change when researchers in the area of innovation identified product users modifying and innovating on their own. In fact, von Hippel, De Jong, and Flowers (2012) found that in a representative sample of UK consumers, more than 6 percent had engaged in product modification or innovation during the prior three years, resulting in annual product development expenditures 1.4 times larger than the respective research and development (R&amp;D) expenditures of all UK firms.

Claude Steele’s self-affirmation theory posits that people are motivated to see themselves as competent and sensible individuals (Steele 1988). When self-integrity is threatened, affirming a central aspect of one’s identity can function to restore integrity and reduce the threat to self. Importantly, Steele describes people’s desire for positive self-regard as fungible; it is not compartamentalized where a threat to self in one domain requires endorsement in that same domain. Unlike a functional benefit of a product or even the more obvious and apparent benefit a consumer places on a beautiful product, affirmation of the self is likely a benefit the consumer is neither aware of nor fully understands. Accordingly, it makes sense that this benefit would be difficult to quantify and reveal itself with an unusual price elasticity. Moreover, the notion that product choice can impact feelings of self-identity intimates the strong psychological relationship between consumer and product and also proposes a strong motivator of choice.</div><div class="gsh_csp">To examine this explanation, in studies 2 and 3 we look specifically at the relationship between an individual’s sense of self and their product choice when options vary on aesthetics.

The success of companies across multiple industries, such as Apple, Target, Nike, and OXO, has been attributed to a focus on aesthetics. Moreover, it has been argued that as product quality parity has become the norm in many categories, manufacturers have looked to aesthetics as a way of differentiating their goods knowing that an attractive product is difficult to pass over (Bloch, 1995; Bloch, Brunel, &amp; Arnold, 2003; Hoegg &amp; Alba, 2008; Patrick &amp; Peracchio, 2010; Schmitt &amp; Simonson, 1997). This ability for aesthetics to influence evaluations and perceptions has been well-documented, even in circumstances beyond consumer products and where one might not expect to see such effects. For example, Yamamoto and Lambert (1994) found that, despite managers claiming otherwise, appearance influenced their choice of industrial products. In the context of financial decision-making, Townsend and Shu (2010) found that the aesthetics of annual reports affected evaluations of companies by experienced investors. These two examples suggest that the influence of aesthetics on evaluation and choice may not be a straightforward deliberative process.</div><div class="gsh_csp">In this chapter, we examine aesthetics in the setting of consumer products, where its value is well-established.

Such sources as the gender of the product promoter or the gender of the customer base have been considered. Although the anthropomorphism of objects is well known, product aesthetics has not been considered in detail as a source of product gender. Because products are judged like people, the process by which we evaluate the gender of people, eg, based on their figure, hair, or skin condition, should apply to products as well. Evolutionary psychology provides insights into which attributes we perceive as feminine or masculine in people, identifying them as cues for attractiveness in mate selection. Motivated by evolutionary psychology and qualitative interviews with designers, in two studies this research considers product aesthetics as a source of product masculinity and femininity and investigates the influence of product gender created by aesthetics on consumer behavior. Across three product categories, the first study identifies the impact of the aesthetic dimensions of form (proportion, shape, and lines); color (tones, contrast, and reflection); and material (texture, surface, and weight) in defining a product’s gender. Evolutionary psychology explains these gender cues in people as an expression of mate value, ie, attractiveness. Having identified a parallel between gender cues for people and products, the positive consequences of strong gender cues in people should also apply to products.

Variety-seeking behavior is fundamentally intriguing because, although people can usually select their favorite options repeatedly, they often choose to include less-preferred options (McAlister and Pessemier 1982). Perhaps not surprisingly, variety-seeking has generated a considerable amount of research focusing on the reasons for this behavior (Kahn and Ratner 2005 for review), such as uncertainty about future preferences (Read and Loewenstein 1995; Simonson 1990), a preference for varied experiences (Ratner, Kahn, and Kahneman 1999), and social norms favoring variety (Ratner and Kahn 2002). But while it is clear that people tend to incorporate variety in their choices for various reasons, new insights suggest that variety may serve additional purposes, and have further antecedents and consequences, than previously considered. Can variety-seeking be driven by vicarious satiation from products that others choose to consume? Might variety serve as a self-presentation instrument, through which consumers convey information about their preferences? Can perceptions of variety be influenced by solely altering the presentation format?

The CRT primarily measures respondents’ propensity to resist reporting the first response that comes to mind. However, its correlation with intelligence measurements allows it to substitute for such a tool as well.

As a result, the perception of beauty can serve as an important driver of consumer behavior such as product choices, willingness to pay, quality perception, etc.(eg, Hoegg, Alba, and Dahl 2010; Page and Herr 2002; Reimann et al. 2010).

Contrary to the traditional wisdom that imagebased logos should outperform their less aesthetically pleasing and attention-grabbing text-based counterparts, the effect of image-based logos depends de facto on brand-awareness.

Prior academic work offers numerous reasons why this type of sharing benefits the brand’s relationship with both the sharer and his social media network. However, most consumers do not engage in this sharing behavior. Thus, it is worth considering how the mere presence of such icons on a webpage may influence consumer behavior, in a manner apart from their intended use. Research shows that “we are what we post”; consumers use the web as a conspicuous form of self-presentation (Schau and Gilly 2003; Wilcox and Stephen 2013). Because conversation via social media is written and thus more asynchronous than oral conversation, it offers greater opportunity to selectively self-present (Walther 2007, 2011). Moreover, this has been shown to have an impact on the products people discuss, with self-presentation having a greater impact online than offline (Berger and Iyengar 2013). On some level consumers are aware of the self-presentational nature of social media.

One of the key ways a product can stand out from others is through its package or shape, as it has been shown that functional and aesthetic appearance is an imperative factor in determining a product’s appeal (Bloch 1995). Despite the growing awareness of the importance of product packaging, it is only fairly recently that we as consumer researchers have begun to develop theory to understand how consumers respond to the appearance of a product or package (Patrick and Peracchio 2010). This session is designed to help fill that gap. This session offers four research papers that study the area of packaging from four separate but complementary view points. All of these projects are in very advanced stages, as they combine for a total of 18 completed experiments. Three of these projects are either under review or being prepared for submission. The first paper in the session,“Transparent Packaging and Consumer Purchase Decisions,” by Darron Billeter, Meng Zhu and J. JeffreyInman, shows that consumers prefer transparent packages as these enhance perceptions of product trustworthiness even in cases where product quality and freshness are controlled for. This finding clearly demonstrates how physical aspects of a product design can affect higher level perceptions such as consumer trust of the product and …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Claudia Townsend and Tatiana Fajardo and Juliano Laran', 'eprint': 'http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/v40/acr_v40_13099.pdf', 'journal': 'ACR North American Advances', 'title': 'Where You Say It Matters: How Product Package Ads Increase Message Believability', 'url': 'http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/v40/acr_v40_13099.pdf', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'fnoJeaMAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Charities service very diverse populations and provide for many vital services, such as health care, education, housing and disaster relief.

Consumer behavior researchers have been interested in how anthropomorphism in turn affects judgments and behavior (Aggarwal and McGill 2007). To date this work has primarily been interested in how anthropomorphism affects quality assessments and overall liking, and studies have contrasted evaluations of anthropomorphized and non-anthropomorphized products. The present research, by contrast, explores situations in which the same degree of anthropomorphism can color judgments differently depending on how people apply beliefs and expectations of social concepts such as power. Moreover, this research focuses on other types of judgments beyond liking, in particular, risk perception.</div><div class="gsh_csp">The central hypothesis of this research is that anthropomorphizing a product causes consumers to apply social expectations and beliefs they would not normally apply to an inanimate entity. For example, for consumers considering playing a slot machine, our hypothesis is that their perception of risk (and so their willingness to play) would depend on whether they see the machine as being human. If the product is not anthropomorphized, risk assessments should follow from nonsocial considerations. However, if the entity is anthropomorphized, risk assessments should follow from beliefs and expectations about human interaction, such as consumers’ perceived social power over others, their degree of trust in others, their sense of personal need, and their view of …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Claudia Townsend and Suzanne Shu', 'eprint': 'http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/v38/acr_v38_15814.pdf', 'journal': 'ACR North American Advances', 'title': 'Aesthetics As Impetus to Riskier Decision-Making', 'url': 'http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/v38/acr_v38_15814.pdf', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'fnoJeaMAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Typically in consumer behavior and decision-making research we examine the general trend of responses–what the majority is doing or choosing. However, it is also informative to look at the differences between individuals. The papers presented in this session examine intelligence, as measured by the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT; Frederick, 2005), its correlates, and how this individual difference impacts various behaviors. The CRT primarily measures respondents’ propensity to resist reporting the first response that comes to mind. However, its correlation with intelligence measurements allows it to substitute for such a tool as well. The works presented here utilize the CRT in both of these capacities to provide new insights both about correlates of this tendency to resist (or not) the first heuristic response, as well as the relationship between intelligence and preferences for risk, time, and aesthetically pleasing products.</div><div class="gsh_csp">In the first presentation Spunt and Lieberman examine the CRT in its primary role to discriminate “gut” first responses from slower more methodological responses. They propose that the propensity to go with one’s initial response is the result of overconfidence. In three behavioral studies they find that reducing confidence in first responses, either through indirect inductions of selfdoubt or by directly invalidating initial responses, can make individuals behave in what seems to be a more intelligent manner. Moreover, the results of a fourth fMRI brain imaging study corroborates this notion. Thus, this work is able to explain something further about the CRT and, subsequently, about response behavior.
