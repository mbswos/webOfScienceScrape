Several rival models were also tested. Finally, “stacked” modeling techniques showed that the parameter estimates developed from the two samples were invariant except for one additional relationship, which was significant in the second sample only. The results supported the indirect effect of transformational leadership on OCBs through procedural justice and trust.

Finally, LMX research has rarely examined the level of analysis at which its findings hold.

In order to address these negative societal trends, proponents of authentic leadership take a very normative approach, placing a strong emphasis on the creation of interventions to facilitate the development of authenticity. We concur with the basic tenets of this initiative.

Using nonparametric and parametric meta-analytic procedures, it was found that the drawing of across-octant conclusions was not supported. Further analyses also showed unequal mean performance levels in octants where levels were supposed to be equal.

Steiner (1972) attributed the diminished interest in small group research, in part, to the fact that empirical research proceeded at a far more rapid pace than the development of theories capable of integrating the findings. Although the status of theory in the area of small groups has not changed a great deal in the intervening years, it is possible to detect the first signs of a renewed interest in the study of groups in organizations. In fact, a major question arising from the most recent meeting of the Academy of Management was whatever happened to groups? Several individuals, most notably Hackman (1976) and Leavitt (1975), have been influential in highlighting the apparent inconsistency between the rather limited way in which we treat groups in our empirical research and the theoretical importance we ascribe to groups in understanding individual behavior and overall organizational functioning. There seems to be little doubt that groups represent an important facet of organizational life and therefore an important area for inquiry.

Thus, I have a real stake in maintaining the status quo—a system of higher education that treats scientific research and publication as the coin-of-the-realm for tenure, promotion, salary, and other key personnel decisions (with teaching and related activities being typically treated as secondary objectives). However, based upon my years of involvement in the extant system I cannot shake the nagging feeling that much of what we do as leadership researchers is not particularly relevant for the real-world development of managers in work organizations—despite the fact that these people are directly and indirectly footing the bill for our research.

It includes seven chapters that are written by leading experts on a diverse range of topics, including abusive supervision attributions, dysfunctional mentors, destructive executives, social exclusion, public and private deviance, instrumental counterproductive behavior, and an examination of the difference between abusive and supportive leadership. Each of these chapters makes a unique contribution to understanding negative workplace behavior and each should stimulate a future stream of research in the same or related domains.

Hunt, Chester A. Schriesheim, and Rosemary Stewart In this concluding chapter, we present an analysis of what we consider the most important general issues revealed by the arguments in this volume. We attempt to do so by locating them in the context of what seems to be conventional in the European and North American traditions. The vehicle we use for this purpose consists of trends observed by a variety of reviewers of the social sciences. We conclude by noting that the diversity of values that underpin research and theory in the areas of leadership and management is now so great that they extend beyond the" structural-functionalist" paradigm. This being the case, we feel it necessary to qualify the conclusion of the previous volume in this series, that is, to promote diversity in order to serve different markets …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Dian-Marie Hosking and James G Hunt and Chester A Schriesheim and Rosemary Stewart', 'pages': '417-424', 'publisher': 'Pergamon', 'title': 'Conclusions: On paradigm shifts in studying leadership', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=309667081322729041&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'year': 1984}, 'citedby': 5, 'id_citations': 'BuCosmcAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '309667081322729041', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Predictions were drawn from path-goal leadership theory about three task dimension moderators of the relationship between instrumental leadership and subordinate supervision satisfaction.

Sportsmanship, conceptualized as a behavioral indicator of employee positivity and persistence in pursuing high performance, is argued to be a potentially important outcome for authentic leadership. Data collected from 203 matched subordinate–supervisor dyads in six organizations from six diverse industries were subjected to contrast analysis with bootstrapping. The results suggest that the indirect effect of authentic leadership on subordinate sportsmanship is mainly via a cognitive process, as opposed to an affective one. Furthermore, it is the employee’s sportsmanship that transmits the effects of authentic leadership on employee task performance.

Drawing on social identity theory, we propose that such a relationship is explained by an escalation of subgroup perception process, i.e., as team members work together, their initial perceptions of the splitting of the team into subgroups deepen. Furthermore, we argue that escalation of subgroup perceptions and its effects on participation in shared leadership depend on the level of task interdependence and individual’s identification with the team.

The intention to misbehave and the decision as to which form of misbehavior one will engage in is assumed to be influenced by two independent forces: An instrumental force reflecting beliefs about personal interests, and a normative force reflecting internalized organizational expectations. One important implication derived from the model is that OMB management is not a linear, but an iterative process.

Although we have access to an overwhelming volume of leadership theory and research, few guidelines exist which are of use to a practitioner. Nevertheless, interest in leadership—and in those qualities which separate a successful leader from an unsuccessful one—remains unabated. In almost any book dealing with management one will find some discussion of leadership. In any company library there are numerous volumes entitled" Increasing Leadership Effectiveness,"" Successful Leadership," or" How to Lead." Typical management development programs conducted within work organizations and universities usually deal with some aspect of leadership. This intensity and duration of writing on the subject and the sums spent annually on leadership training indicate that practicing managers and academicians consider good leadership essential to organizational success. What is meant by leadership, let alone good leadership? Many definitions have been proposed, and it seems that most are careful to separate management from leadership. This distinction sometimes becomes blurred in everyday conversations. The first term, management, includes those processes, both mental and physical, which result in other people executing prescribed formal duties for organizational goal attainment.

Primary themes discussed here include: contrasting perspectives of US and foreign researchers, differences in epistemological assumptions underlying the study of leadership, varying concepts of what is meant by leadership, and contrasts between micro and macro aspects of leadership. The traditional realist perspective on leadership sees it as a concept independent of the observer, and subject to laws assumed to be inherent in its objective nature. The interpretive, social constructionist perspective defines it as something that emerges out of the complex social political network of relationships in organizations.

Viewed from this perspective, Causal Analysis does not achieve its purpose. Well-read scholars, looking for a treatment of causal analysis that goes well beyond the existing literature, probably will be disappointed with Causal Analysis because it is not" radically innovative" and it does not break a lot of new ground for researchers interested in studying organizations.

Such a period is one where" the major tasks are to reappraise the existing structure, explore new possibilities... and work toward choices that provide a basis for a new structure"(Levinson, 1978, p. 317). It was further argued that we could not yet tell what the new structure would look like but that it would probably be highly pluralistic with" different models for different purposes, in contrast to one or a few grand models"(Hunt, Sekaran &amp; Schriesheim, 1982, p. 6).

One hundred-fifty undergraduates were given the written managerial description and asked to complete a questionnaire containing 20 IS and C items in one of three forms: all positively worded, all negative, and mixed.

Most real-world problems in this area are sufficiently complex to warrant a sequential or top-down approach to problem solving. However, researchers have paid scant attention to the intermediate phase of disaggregation until very recently. The resulting lack of an interfacing mechanism diminishes the utility of solution procedures for aggregate planning, inventory control, and scheduling. In order to draw attention to this hiatus, a taxonomy of disaggregation problems is developed for both manufacturing and service organizations. For each category in the taxonomy, the problem structure is described, research findings are summarized, and unresolved issues identified.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Chester Schriesheim and Dale Achabal and Eric N Berkowitz and Frederick D Stocker and Frederick D Sturdivant and John C Henderson and Lee J Krajewski and Reza Moinpour and Steven Kerr and Larry P Ritzman and James Lee Ginter and James Madison Tolliver and John W Slocum and Mark I Alpert and Reuben R McDaniel and W Wayne Talarzyk and Charles J Murphy and Gerald R Wagner and James B Wiley', 'number': '1-12', 'publisher': 'College of Administrative Science, The Ohio State University', 'title': 'Disaggregation in Manufacturing and Service Organizations: Survey of Problem Structures and Research Findings', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4003280162678204635&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'BuCosmcAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'author': 'Chester Schriesheim and James Madison Tolliver and Charles J Murphy', 'publisher': 'College of Administrative Science, Ohio State University', 'title': 'The Validity of the Intrinsic-extrinsic Satisfaction Subscales of the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire (short Form)', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2634380095765887239&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'BuCosmcAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">The effects of the sex of the leader and the subordinate on the relationship between leader role assumption (measured by Consideration and Initiating Structure) and subordinate extrinsic, intrinsic, and general job satisfaction, and on-the-job anxiety are examined in a black social services organization.
