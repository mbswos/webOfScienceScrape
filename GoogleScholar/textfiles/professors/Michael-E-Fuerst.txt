We observe that innovations have no history of returns from projects implementing the new technology; whereas standard technologies have a long history of project outcomes.    We view markets as clearinghouses of information that cross-sectionally <i> proxies for a project history</i>. In a market, any agent may contribute a market order without commitment to a market maker who sets a fair interest rate or rejects the project based on the information contained in the order flow. As markets only noisily reveal informed investors information, they promote aggregation of costly information through trading profits to the informed. The market\'s information acts to select out good new technologies and provide them funding. Alternatively, banking is a competitive oligopoly of capital lending firms acting in informational isolation but capable of a special function: <i> monitoring</i> of the borrowing firm. By monitoring, a bank keeps an entrepreneur from undertaking a wasteful but personally more profitable project in place of the lower profit innovation (post-lending asset substitution moral hazard).    Over the innovation life cycle, there is a dynamic interaction between learning (about a new technology) and the optimal funding source. For example, initially a financial market may be the optimal supplier of funds for a technology; however, as learning occurs and technological uncertainty is resolved, moral hazard costs may come to dominate any benefits from additional information aggregation.

In this study we employ data that were recently made available by Barth, Caprio and Levine (2001) on bank regulation across many countries. We test various hypotheses about the impact of regulation on bank industry structure and performance. Our measures of regulation include whether government policy permits banks to engage in securities, insurance, and real estate activities and to integrate banking and commercial activities.

Using a sample of all publicly traded German corporations as of 2003, they find employee representation significantly increases the market-to-book value ratio (MV/BV) for firms in industries with complex processes and demanding intense coordination among employees. The improved information flow and the additional insight provided by employee representation to the highest levels of the firm allows for improved corporate decision making. Second, they find that MV/BV for firms in more concentrated industries—that is, industries with fewer competitive forces—is higher when employees are present on the corporate board. The reduced competition and greater free cash flow in concentrated industries indicates that employee representatives in these industries provide information that improves efficiency and acts as a substitute for competitive pressure. Third, they find some evidence of diminishing marginal benefits from employee representation after a threshold of approximately one-third employee representation. However, higher levels of representation still improve firm value in complex industries that demand high levels of coordination.</div><div class="gsh_csp">The analysis suggests that the judicious use of employee representation can increase share price.

Recent empirical evidence indicates that large banks tend to employ standard financial criteria in the loan decision process while small banks deviate from this and rely more on the character of the borrower. Further, ownership incentives and monitoring costs appear central to the design of banking organizations: small and large banks appear to have different comparative advantages with different types of firms. This paper develops a model that explains the difference in lending procedures between big banks and small banks. We show that the organization of the bank affects its ability to deal with the informational problems associated with lending to certain borrowers.
