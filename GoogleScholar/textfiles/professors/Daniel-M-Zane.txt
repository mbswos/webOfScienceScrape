Across three studies, willfully ignorant consumers negatively judge ethical others they have never met across various disparate personality traits (e.g., fashionable, boring). The denigration arises from the self-threat inherent in negative social comparison with others who acted ethically instead of choosing not to do so. In addition, this denigration has detrimental downstream consequences, undermining the denigrator\'s commitment to ethical values, as evidenced by reduced anger toward firms who violate the ethical principle in question and reduced intention to behave ethically in the future. There are two moderators of the effect: Denigration becomes less strong if willfully ignorant consumers have a second opportunity to act …</div></div></div></div></div>', 'author': 'Daniel M Zane and Julie R Irwin and Rebecca Walker Reczek', 'eprint': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057740815001011', 'journal': 'Journal of Consumer Psychology', 'number': '3', 'pages': '337-349', 'publisher': 'No longer published by Elsevier', 'title': 'Do less ethical consumers denigrate more ethical consumers?

Because consumers want to avoid emotionally difficult ethical information (e.g., child labor) but believe they should remember it in order to do the right thing, the presence of negative ethical information in a choice or evaluation produces conflict between the want and should selves. Consumers resolve this conflict by letting the want self prevail and forgetting or misremembering the negative ethical information. A series of studies establishes the willfully ignorant memory effect, shows that it holds only for ethical attributes and not for other attributes, and provides process evidence that it is driven by consumers allowing the want self to prevail in order to avoid negative …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Rebecca Walker Reczek and Julie R Irwin and Daniel M Zane and Kristine R Ehrich', 'eprint': 'https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-pdf/45/1/185/24802072/ucx120.pdf', 'journal': 'Journal of Consumer Research', 'number': '1', 'pages': '185-207', 'publisher': 'Oxford University Press', 'title': 'That’s not how I remember it: Willfully ignorant memory for ethical product attribute information', 'url': 'https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/45/1/185/4711097', 'volume': '45', 'year': 2017}, 'citedby': 10, 'id_citations': 'DDUuwnAAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C', 'id_scholarcitedby': '14747709744247997189', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">• Consumers will perceive low overlap between contents of ad and distraction= interest lay theory when advertised brand is from a product category in which they have they little interest• When interest in advertised product category is low, if a consumer is a distracted by a background ad, he or she will recognize that the distraction does not signal interest in the brand</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Daniel M Zane and Robert W Smith and Rebecca Walker Reczek', 'eprint': 'https://www.msi.org/uploads/summaries/MSI_Deck_18-115.pdf', 'title': 'The Meaning of Distraction: How Metacognitive Inferences from Distraction Affect Brand Evaluations', 'url': 'https://www.msi.org/uploads/summaries/MSI_Deck_18-115.pdf', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'DDUuwnAAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small">In the age of the Internet, where marketers can ensure that a promotion is distributed on a specific day, firms increasingly offer promotions around “special days” (e.g., a 31.4% discount for Pi Day on March 14th).

This tendency toward multitasking often relegates marketing messages (ie, advertisements) to the role of background stimuli while consumers focus on other tasks. In this research, we explore how consumers are impacted by background advertisements while they multitask. We propose that when listening to an ad is a non-focal task and consumers find themselves more distracted by it than expected, they draw on an underlying lay theory that distraction implies interest to make the metacognitive inference that they are interested in the advertised product. While the dominant lay theory is that distraction signals interest, a competing lay theory, that distraction signals annoyance, can instead produce opposite conclusions. In line with this, we also demonstrate that sometimes being more distracted than expected can instead lead consumers’ to infer decreased interest in an advertised product, depending on which lay theory is accessible at the time of judgment. This research uncovers a new metacognitive cue that consumers use to form evaluations of products, advances the scarce literature on the effects of consumer multitasking, and provides practical insight into how consumers are influenced by background advertisements during multitasking episodes.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Daniel M Zane and Robert W Smith and Rebecca Walker Reczek', 'eprint': 'https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a37b/871fdd778c1684f8cd16dd01506b6948aed2.pdf#page=101', 'journal': 'ROBERT MITTELSTAEDT DOCTORAL SYMPOSIUM PROCEEDINGS', 'pages': '77', 'title': 'DRAWING CONCLUSIONS FROM DISTRACTION: DISTRACTING ADS CUE CONSUMERS TO INFER PRODUCT INTEREST THROUGH METACOGNITIVE INFERENCES', 'url': 'https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a37b/871fdd778c1684f8cd16dd01506b6948aed2.pdf#page=101', 'year': 2016}, 'id_citations': 'DDUuwnAAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Background Ads Cue Consumers to Infer Product Interest Through Metacognitive Inferences", in NA-Advances in Consumer</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Daniel M Zane and Robert W Smith and Rebecca Walker Reczek', 'eprint': 'http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/v44/acr_vol44_1022476.pdf', 'journal': 'ACR North American Advances', 'title': 'Drawing Conclusions While Multitasking: Distracting Background Ads Cue Consumers to Infer Product Interest Through Metacognitive Inferences', 'url': 'http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/v44/acr_vol44_1022476.pdf', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'DDUuwnAAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Our research examines the effects of community members’ identity self-disclosure which we posit to be an underlying mechanism in the success of online communities.

From the music industry and social media to television shows and everyday consumer interactions, brands appear to often find their way into conversations. A number of these brands appear to be expensive and prestige brands. In this work we examine how brand name-dropping of expensive and prestige brands affect observers’ perceptions of the actor (ie, name dropper). With few exceptions (Ferraro, Kirmani, and Matherly 2013), little work has studied conspicuous brand usage, which includes the more specific act of brand name-dropping. At one level, brand name-dropping can be viewed as a specific instance or means of displaying status, commonly referred to as conspicuous consumption. As discussed by Thorstein Veblen (1899), a central idea behind conspicuous consumption is to portray one’s wealth to others. More than a century later, a renewed interest has emerged in the benefits of conspicuous consumption with respect to its signaling value (Griskevicius et al. 2007; Nelissen and Meijers 2011; Sundie et al. 2011; Wang and Griskevicius 2014) and means of addressing psychological needs, such as a desire for power and status (Rucker and Galinsky 2008, 2009; see also Dubois, Rucker, and Galinsky 2012). This prior work suggests that conspicuous consumption is largely positive or produces favorable social outcomes. However, recent work introduces the notion that conspicuous consumption carries with it social costs such as negative attitudes toward the consumer (Ferraro et al. 2013). These two streams of work …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Julie R Irwin and Daniel M Zane and Rebecca Walker Reczek', 'eprint': 'http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/v43/acr_vol43_1019390.pdf', 'journal': 'ACR North American Advances', 'title': 'Disparaging Ethical Others: When and Why Willfully Ignorant Consumers Negatively Judge Others Who Seek Out Ethical Product Information', 'url': 'http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/v43/acr_vol43_1019390.pdf', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'DDUuwnAAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC', 'source': 'citations'}]
