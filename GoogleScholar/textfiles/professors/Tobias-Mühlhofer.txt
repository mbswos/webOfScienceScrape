REIT mutual fund returns are typically presented relative to the return on a simple value‐weighted REIT index. We ask whether including additional factors when benchmarking funds\' returns can improve the explanatory power of the models and offer more precise estimates of alpha. We investigate three sets of REIT‐based benchmarks, plus an index of returns derived from non‐REIT real estate firms, namely homebuilders and real estate operating companies. The REIT‐based factors are a set of characteristic factors, a set of property‐type factors and a set of statistical factors. Using traditional single‐index benchmarks, we find that about 6% of the REIT funds exhibit significant positive performance using traditional significance …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Jay C Hartzell and Tobias Mühlhofer and Sheridan D Titman', 'eprint': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1540-6229.2009.00253.x', 'journal': 'Real Estate Economics', 'number': '1', 'pages': '121-154', 'publisher': 'Blackwell Publishing Inc', 'title': 'Alternative benchmarks for evaluating mutual fund performance', 'url': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-6229.2009.00253.x', 'volume': '38', 'year': 2010}, 'citedby': 59, 'id_citations': 'ElGqDhoAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '2543584642238969906', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">This study addresses the short‐term disparity between REIT returns and direct property returns, and argues that this phenomenon is due to the trading constraints in the direct property market imposed on REITs (<i>the dealer rule</i>).

We observe that, in the short run, REIT investors are only exposed to the income cash flows of a REIT\'s underlying portfolio and not to its property price  fluctuations. Specifically, investors miss out on the component of appreciation returns not contained in income. Chapter 3 observes this phenomenon and argues, without proof, that this is due to the trading restrictions that REITs face in order to operate tax free, which impose minimum holding periods on properties in REITs\' portfolios. Chapters 4 and 5 show that the trading-restrictions explanation is indeed the reason for this phenomenon. Specifically, chapter 4 tests how REITs with different firm characteristics are differently affected by the trading constraints. Firstly, we test for size effects and find that medium-sized and large firms offer investors better exposure to short-term  fluctuations in property appreciation than small firms. This supports the trading restrictions hypothesis, as large firms are less affected by these. Secondly, we test for the effects of the degree of diversification in a REIT\'s portfolio and find that, while investing in a REIT which is diversified by property type gives an investor better exposure to appreciation cash flows, investing in one whose portfolio is merely geographically diversified does not. Finally, we test whether UPREITs give an investor better exposure to property appreciation cash flows and find strongly that this is so. Since the partnership that holds the property in an UPREIT is not subject to selling constraints, we find our hypothesis strongly supported.

We use a unique data set of directly held commercial real estate and augment information in REIT dividends with information from cash flows in this parallel market. In this study we demonstrate the improvement that the addition of this information gives to traditional dividend pricing models. First, we estimate the fraction of the variation in asset returns that can be attributed to various types of cash flows and economic news. We find that innovations in dividends are a central component in explaining return variation in our data set. When we supplement REIT dividends with direct property dividends as state variables, we find that innovations in economic variables explain approximately 24% of REIT return variation. This number is higher than the approximately one-fifth of total variation explained in the stock market as reported in the classic study by Cutler, Poterba and Summers (1989). In the second part of the paper, we apply a dynamic dividend discount model to REITs. When only information from REIT dividends is taken into account, the model performs somewhat better than was previously found in the case of stock returns and stock dividends (Campbell and Shiller (1988)), which is generally congruous with the nature of REITs and the information content of their …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Tobias Mühlhofer and Andrey D Ukhov', 'eprint': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andrey_Ukhov/publication/228718501_Ultimate_Sources_of_Asset_Price_Variability_Evidence_from_Real_Estate_Investment_Trusts1/links/0a85e5303960ce5313000000.pdf', 'title': 'Ultimate Sources of Asset Price Variability: Evidence from Real Estate Investment Trusts1', 'url': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andrey_Ukhov/publication/228718501_Ultimate_Sources_of_Asset_Price_Variability_Evidence_from_Real_Estate_Investment_Trusts1/links/0a85e5303960ce5313000000.pdf', 'year': 2009}, 'id_citations': 'ElGqDhoAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">In this paper, we address the dichotomy in short-term performance between REITs and direct property by arguing that REITs are primarily income vehicles, and that an end investor in a REIT does not have access to short-term appreciation opportunities contained in direct property prices. In order to do this, we compare the useful incremental information content contained in property-level income to that contained in propertylevel appreciation. We find that over our entire 1978-2003 sample both income and appreciation provide useful information content in explaining REIT returns, but over any subsample periods that we analyze, only income provides useful information and appreciation does not. These findings support our hypothesis and provide a possible explanation for the short-term pricing dichotomy. 1∗ Research Papers in Spatial &amp; Environmental Analysis, No. 97.
