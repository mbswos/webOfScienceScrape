For example, when calibrated to accurately price at-the-money options the Black-Scholes (1973) model often misprices deep in-the-money and deep out-of-themoney options. This model-anomalous behavior gives rise to what options professionals call “volatility smiles.” A volatility smile is the skewed pattern that results from calculating implied volatilities across a range of strike prices for an option series. This phenomenon is not predicted by the Black-Scholes (1973) model, since volatility is a property of the underlying instrument and the same implied volatility value should be observed across all options on that instrument. Volatility smiles are generally thought to result from the parsimonious assumptions used to derive the Black-Scholes model. In particular, the Black-Scholes (1973) model assumes that security log prices follow a constant variance diffusion process. The constant variance assumption has been tested and rejected in early studies by Beckers (1980), Black and Scholes (1972), Christie</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Charles Corrado and Tie Su', 'eprint': 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.496.8&rep=rep1&type=pdf', 'journal': 'Journal of Futures Markets: Futures, Options, and Other Derivative Products', 'number': '4', 'pages': '363-378', 'publisher': 'Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Company', 'title': 'An empirical test of the Hull‐White option pricing model', 'url': 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.496.8&rep=rep1&type=pdf', 'volume': '18', 'year': 1998}, 'citedby': 15, 'id_citations': 'smcL-c4AAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '4733888233843557821', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">This paper makes indirect inference about the time variation in expected stock returns by comparing unconditional sample variances to estimates of expected conditional variances.

Estimating option implied R squares requires an assumption about the implied volatility horizon, the return measurement interval for which the implied variance is the conditional variance. We estimate the implied volatility horizon to be one month, for one month options on individual stocks, using the Black Scholes model. The option implied R squares for individual stocks average 20%, which is higher than regression R squares on a standard set of market wide lagged instruments.

An effective investor-relations program can benefit the corporation. A survey of 150 chartered financial analysts (CFAs) found that 70% believe that an effective investor-relations program has a positive effect on stock prices (Kennedy and Wilson, 1980). Better-informed shareholders and analysts are also more likely to support" the long-term strategic plans and objectives of the company"(Pound, 1993). Merton (1987) derives a model in which increasing a compeiny\'s investor base reduces its cost of capital and increases its share price. Thus, investor relations activities which attract new investors and retain current investors may enhance the value of the firm. The attention paid to investor relations is growing among corporations.

It measures how much the option price changes for a small change in the underlying security. Hedge ratios are widely used in risk management. They can be used to specify the number of option contracts needed to neutralize price movements in a stock portfolio. Due to its elegance and simplicity, the Black-Scholes (1973) option-pricing formula has been well accepted by many finance professionals. Even though a number of empirical studies have shown that the Black-Scholes model produces certain systematic pricing errors, finance academics and practitioners generally agree that the Black-Scholes model provides a simple and effective way to price and hedge stock and stock index options. This paper provides a simple derivation for the hedge ratios of call and put options within the Black-Scholes option-pricing framework. Mathematically, a hedge ratio is the partial derivative of the option price with respect to the price of the underlying security. However, because of complication in taking partial derivatives in a Black-Scholes option price, existing derivations of hedge ratios are mathematically involved and difficult to follow. This paper provides a succinct proof to the hedge ratios of Black-Scholes call and put options. The paper is organized as follows. The next section presents the Black-Scholes (1973) option-pricing model, and then I present a simple derivation of the hedge ratios of Black-Scholes call and put options.

This occurs because of the innate fear that rapid economic growth will spur the Fed to raise interest rates to counteract inflation. This “reaction hypothesis” has become so ingrained that unexpected increases in real variables, such as Payroll Employment, often lead to broad-based declines in equity prices in anticipation of future Federal Reserve actions—a response that appears counterintuitive at first glance. Because of this, the popular financial press has nicknamed the first Friday of the month, when employment and unemployment figures are released,“Freaky Friday”. The importance of macro-economic data was underscored in the fall of 1998 when an employee mistakenly released Unemployment Rate data to the web site managed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics a day early. The release was discovered by a private consultant who distributed its contents to clients and the information was credited with significantly increasing demand at an upcoming Treasury auction.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Andrea J Heuson and Tie Su', 'eprint': 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.35.1983&rep=rep1&type=pdf', 'title': 'The Response Of Sector Index Options On Treasury Securities To Macro-Economic Announcements', 'url': 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.35.1983&rep=rep1&type=pdf', 'year': 1999}, 'id_citations': 'smcL-c4AAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">We examine the reaction of prices, volume, spreads, and trading location when firms experience unanticipated events.
