These are products such as dairy, canned products, or pharmaceuticals, which have an expiration date. The model minimizes costs and CO2 emissions due to inventory replenishment. The model presented in this paper is an extension of the economic lot-sizing model and captures the trade-offs between transportation and inventory costs, transportation mode and remaining shelf life of a product, and replenishment costs and emissions. The model considers different transportation modes; each mode has its own capacity, cost structure and lead time. Transportation modes considered include full truckloads, refrigerated trucks, and less-than-truckload. The model assumes a planning horizon of length T that repeats cyclically over time. The model is solved using a …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Sandra D Eksioglu and Zahra Azadi and Joseph P Geunes', 'eprint': 'http://search.proquest.com/openview/c5b06d64b16c0dfeeb7f3b15772c7478/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=51908', 'journal': 'IIE Annual Conference.

Ample evidence suggests that low vaccination coverage in developing countries is caused by vaccine stockout and high rates of vaccine wastage. Wastage occurs when a vaccine vial is physically damaged or exposed to extreme temperatures, or when doses from an open vial are discarded after their safe-use time expires. The latter is referred to as open vial wastage (OVW). Clinics can use single-dose vials to reduce OVW; however, such an approach is more expensive than using multi-dose vials. The focus of this research is to develop new policies that support vaccine administration and inventory replenishment. These policies are expected to reduce OVW, reduce the cost of vaccinations, and improve vaccination coverage levels in developing countries.

This paper proposes a two-stage stochastic optimization model that selects suppliers, identifies a replenishment schedule for a periodic-review inventory system with non-stationary demand and supply, and determines the timing and size of a price markdown in order to maximize retailer’s profits. In this model, the first-stage problem is bilinear since it captures the additive relationship between price and demand. Therefore, we develop a solution approach which extends the Benders decomposition algorithm via a piecewise linear approximation method to solve the first-stage problem. A case study is presented to validate the model. Numerical experiments suggest that supply chain profits are enhanced by integrating inventory management with pricing decisions.</div></div></div></div></div>', 'author': 'Zahra Azadi and Sandra D Eksioglu and Burak Eksioglu and Gokce Palak', 'eprint': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360835218305424', 'journal': 'Computers & Industrial Engineering', 'pages': '625-642', 'publisher': 'Pergamon', 'title': 'Stochastic optimization models for joint pricing and inventory replenishment of perishable products', 'url': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360835218305424', 'volume': '127', 'year': 2019}, 'id_citations': 'hyyaeBQAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'author': 'Zahra Azadi and Sandra Eksioglu and Burak Eksioglu and Gokce Palak', 'title': 'Two-stage Stochastic Programming For Joint Pricing and Inventory Management of Perishable Products', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'hyyaeBQAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'author': 'Zahra Azadi and Sandra Eksioglu and Burak Eksioglu and Gokce Palak', 'title': 'Stochastic Optimization Models For Joint Pricing and Inventory Management of Perishable Products', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'hyyaeBQAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'author': 'A Khuand and Zahra Azadi and Sandra Duni Eksioglu and Burak Eksioglu', 'title': 'A Production Scheduling Model for Compounded Sterile Products', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'hyyaeBQAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'author': 'Zahra Azadi and Harsha Gangammanavar and Sandra Eksioglu', 'title': 'Two-stage Stochastic Programming For Vaccine Vial Replenishment', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'hyyaeBQAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'author': 'Mahyar Mehrnegar and Amir Nezhad and Zahra Azadi', 'title': 'modified ed neighborhood search heuristic for scheduling parallel machines with Sequence dependent setup times', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'hyyaeBQAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">We present a two-stage stochastic linear programming model to manage the inventory of vaccine vials in developing countries. In these countries immunization programs often involve targeted outreach services in remote locations. Organizations managing these programs are in need of tools which identify inventory replenishment and vaccine utilization plans to minimize costs and wastage while achieving greater coverage level. Wastage incurs when doses are discarded from open vials after their safe use time. We propose a model which identifies optimal portfolios of different sized vaccine vials, and corresponding vial-opening decisions in the face of uncertainty in patient arrival. This model is a two-stage stochastic program which we solve using an extension of the stochastic Benders decomposition algorithm (L-shaped method). Computational results on instances built using data from Bangladesh reveal that our solution approach outperforms the standard L-shaped method. Experimental results are used to develop simple and economic vaccine administration policies usable by healthcare administrators.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Zahra Azadi and Harsha Gangammanavar and Sandra Eksioglu', 'eprint': 'http://www.optimization-online.org/DB_FILE/2016/08/5600.pdf', 'pages': 'http://www.optimization-online.org/DB_HT', 'title': 'Stochastic Optimization of Vaccine Vial Replenishment', 'url': 'http://www.optimization-online.org/DB_FILE/2016/08/5600.pdf'}, 'id_citations': 'hyyaeBQAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC', 'source': 'citations'}]
