In particular, we consider how the frequency of these expected changes affects the optimal pattern of bid sequences (e.g., strictly increasing over time or following a nonmonotonic pattern). We find that when the probability of a price change is moderate, consumers may have an incentive to use nonmonotonic bidding patterns.

The execution of this function is mitigated by feelings of safety, a counterforce to concerns about the harmful consequences of goal pursuit.

This tendency to ignore previously predictive features is consistent with a desire to protect prior learning.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Marcus Cunha Jr and Chris Janiszewski and Juliano Laran', 'eprint': 'https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-pdf/34/6/850/17929690/34-6-850.pdf', 'journal': 'Journal of Consumer Research', 'number': '6', 'pages': '850-864', 'publisher': 'The University of Chicago Press', 'title': 'Protection of prior learning in complex consumer learning environments', 'url': 'https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/34/6/850/1845416', 'volume': '34', 'year': 2007}, 'citedby': 29, 'id_citations': 'gkY_OTAAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C', 'id_scholarcitedby': '4629949982071771713', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">O artigo apresenta o teste de um novo modelo, teoricamente lastreado, da influência das surpresas positiva e negativa no processo de formação da satisfação.

Para tanto, as escolas positivista, relativista e pós-moderna são confrontadas, gerando algumas perspectivas para as pesquisas futuras sobre o comportamento do consumidor.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Leonardo Nicolao and Juliano Aita Larán', 'eprint': 'http://eduem.uem.br/laboratorio/ojs/index.php/rimar/article/download/26338/14092', 'journal': 'Revista Interdisciplinar de Marketing', 'number': '2', 'pages': '46-61', 'title': 'A dominância paradigmática na pesquisa em comportamento do consumidor e a busca por uma perspectiva pluralista', 'url': 'http://eduem.uem.br/laboratorio/ojs/index.php/rimar/article/view/26338', 'volume': '1', 'year': 2015}, 'citedby': 5, 'id_citations': 'gkY_OTAAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C', 'id_scholarcitedby': '3189463886581122743', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'author': 'Juliano Aita LARÁN', 'journal': '25º Encontro Nacional da Associação Nacional de Pós-graduação em Administração–ENANPAD', 'pages': '16-19', 'title': 'Planejamento Estratégico em Instituições de Ensino Superior: Um estido de caso do Curso de Administração de Empresas da Unisinos', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14376577253800951950&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'year': 2001}, 'citedby': 5, 'id_citations': 'gkY_OTAAAAAJ:EUQCXRtRnyEC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '14376577253800951950', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Procrastination can have a negative effect on both individual and organizational productivity. This research examines how being busy influences procrastination when people have missed a deadline for completing a task. We demonstrate that missing a task deadline results in negative emotions that lead people to procrastinate, but that being busy mitigates these negative emotions. Therefore, when people have missed a deadline, they are less likely to procrastinate when they have many (vs. few) tasks to complete. Empirical evidence for this conceptualization is provided by an analysis of 586,808 real tasks from a software application designed to help people manage their tasks. One field study and two experiments replicate these findings and demonstrate that the extent to which people experience negative emotions from missing a deadline explains the effect of being busy on procrastination.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Andrew T Stephen and Keith Wilcox and Juliano Laran and Peter Pal Zubcsek', 'eprint': 'http://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/mygsb/faculty/research/pubfiles/5892/Procrastination%20and%20Being%20Busy%20-%20Final.pdf', 'journal': 'Columbia Business School', 'title': 'How Being Busy Overcomes Procrastination and Enhances Productivity', 'url': 'http://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/mygsb/faculty/research/pubfiles/5892/Procrastination%20and%20Being%20Busy%20-%20Final.pdf', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 2, 'id_citations': 'gkY_OTAAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '2160450745152533096', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'author': 'Juliano Laran and N Amy', 'publisher': 'Andrade', 'title': 'Dalton, and Eduardo B', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9361363544181634461&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 2, 'id_citations': 'gkY_OTAAAAAJ:bFI3QPDXJZMC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '9361363544181634461', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'author': 'Juliano LARÁN', 'title': 'A influência da surpresa no processo emocional de formação da satisfação do consumidor.

They might pursue a goal to be healthy, for instance, by choosing healthy snacks or standing rather than sitting at their desk. Making an initial goal-congruent choice, however, often leaves people less motivated to continue pursuing the goal afterward, resulting in a variety of undesirable behaviors (e.g., eating a substantial piece of cake). The current research proposes a novel way to reduce this post-choice goal disengagement effect: restricting consumers’ sense of choice freedom. Three experiments support this prediction and demonstrate why it occurs: by reducing the goal progress an initial choice of means is perceived to accomplish. Restricting perceived choice freedom can thus help sustain post-choice motivation to pursue valued goals. The findings contribute to the literatures on goals and choice freedom, and offer practical insight into how to …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Jordan Etkin and Juliano Laran', 'eprint': 'http://moya.bus.miami.edu/~jularan/Papers/Freedom_JACR.pdf', 'journal': 'Journal of the Association for Consumer Research', 'number': '1', 'pages': '36-46', 'publisher': 'University of Chicago Press', 'title': 'Restricting Choice Freedom Reduces Post-choice Goal Disengagement', 'url': 'https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/701450', 'volume': '4', 'year': 2019}, 'id_citations': 'gkY_OTAAAAAJ:P5F9QuxV20EC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"> <div class="gsh_csp">Benign and malicious envy are a consequence of an unfavorable upward comparison to another individual (i.e., a negative self-other discrepancy).

Prior research has shown that benign envy motivates a person to address the self-other discrepancy via self-improvement, whereas malicious envy does not. This research shows that both types of envy, not just benign envy, can motivate self-improvement, provided that the opportunities to do so occur outside the envy-eliciting domain.

This research investigates two factors that help sustain the pursuit of a nonconscious goal: increasing the level of goal activation prior to goal pursuit and limiting the extent of goal deactivation after a goal-consistent behavior.

As such, over the past decades, intrinsic motivation has received much attention from various disciplines. Researchers have made considerable progress in understanding how the effective functioning of intrinsic motivation is affected by extrinsic motivators, such as threats of punishment (Deci and Cascio 1972), deadlines (Amabile et al. 1976), rewards (Deci 1971) and monitoring measurements (Etkin 2016). Yet, our understanding of the psychological, emotional, and social determinants of intrinsic motivation remains limited. The proposed session highlights the newest research on how the everyday feelings of scarcity and busyness and our tendencies towards social comparison and impression management might undermine intrinsic motivation.

As such, over the past decades, intrinsic motivation has received much attention from various disciplines. Researchers have made considerable progress in understanding how the effective functioning of intrinsic motivation is affected by extrinsic motivators, such as threats of punishment (Deci and Cascio 1972), deadlines (Amabile et al. 1976), rewards (Deci 1971) and monitoring measurements (Etkin 2016). Yet, our understanding of the psychological, emotional, and social determinants of intrinsic motivation remains limited.

Similarly, after having a hedonic experience, consumers may prefer to have another hedonic experience or a utilitarian experience. We propose that the cognitive processes involved in analyzing the benefits of an experience that differs on the hedonic-utilitarian dimension require mental resources. As a result, after having an initial experience, consumers who have (vs. do not have) a high level of mental resources are better able to identify the benefits of a dissimilar experience and show higher preference for this experience. This suggests that an initial utilitarian experience will lead to preference for a hedonic experience when consumers have a high level of mental resources available, but a utilitarian experience when they do not.

Studies 1 and 2 show that when people are busy, they are more motivated to complete a task after missing a deadline than those who are not busy, and that the perception that one is using time effectively mediates this effect. Studies 3 and 4 show that this process makes busy people more likely to complete real tasks than people who are not busy. Study 5 uses data from over half a million tasks submitted by thousands of users of a task management software application to show that busy people take less time to complete a task after they miss a deadline for completing it.

The current research shows that this seemingly contradictory influence can be accounted for by considering the information about the event that generated the pride (ie, appraisal information) and whether or not a self-regulatory goal is active. In the absence of a self-regulatory goal, appraisal information concerning the locus of control (eg,“I contributed to this achievement, it was not luck”) can be used to make positive inferences about one’s selfconcept that reinforce further self-regulation. In the presence of a self-regulatory goal, appraisal information concerning personal agency (eg,“This was my achievement, not someone else’s achievement”) can be used to make positive inferences about one’s progress toward selfregulation that, in turn, licenses indulgence. Thus, appraisal information, and the presence of self-regulatory goals, is critical to how a self-conscious emotion, like pride, influences subsequent behavior. Implications and potential extensions in the areas of self-conscious emotions, goals, and self-regulation are discussed.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'CHRIS JANISZEWSKI', 'eprint': 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.974.1024&rep=rep1&type=pdf', 'title': 'ANTHONY SALERNO JULIANO LARAN CHRIS JANISZEWSKI', 'url': 'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.974.1024&rep=rep1&type=pdf', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'gkY_OTAAAAAJ:pyW8ca7W8N0C', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Planning has been argued to be beneficial for improving consumer welfare, ensuring people are more motivated to pursue their goals such as exercising more and saving more money (Lusardi and Mitchell 2007; Sniehotta et al. 2005).

For instance, we now know that consumers often “eat with their eyes” rather than with their stomachs; that is, they stop eating when their plate is empty rather than when they feel full (Wansink 2007). We also know that obesity can be an epidemic and spread like a disease (Christakis and Fowler 2007).</div><div class="gsh_csp">For those interested in regulating their food consumption, at least three major lessons have emerged. The first lesson is that we should watch out for moments in which we are vulnerable to overconsumption of unhealthy food. Findings reveal that we have a predilection for such food when we are feeling sad or when our ego is depleted. The second lesson is that we should stay away from tempting stimuli whenever possible: avoidance is the best policy (Hoch and Loewenstein 1991). The third lesson is that we should watch out for sub-conscious influences that steer us toward unhealthy food. Raghunathan et al.(2006) show that most of us aren’t even aware of the influence of the unhealthy= tasty intuition—which steers us toward unhealthy food when we want something tasty—on our food choices. The set of four papers in this special session report findings that challenge each of these three themes from past research.

This phenomenon has spawned a new emphasis on “shopper marketing,” which entails examining consumer’s in-store decision making from the store back and identifying what might influence the shopper. One of the key ways a product can stand out from others is through its package or shape, as it has been shown that functional and aesthetic appearance is an imperative factor in determining a product’s appeal (Bloch 1995). Despite the growing awareness of the importance of product packaging, it is only fairly recently that we as consumer researchers have begun to develop theory to understand how consumers respond to the appearance of a product or package (Patrick and Peracchio 2010). This session is designed to help fill that gap. This session offers four research papers that study the area of packaging from four separate but complementary view points. All of these projects are in very advanced stages, as they combine for a total of 18 completed experiments. Three of these projects are either under review or being prepared for submission. The first paper in the session,“Transparent Packaging and Consumer Purchase Decisions,” by Darron Billeter, Meng Zhu and J.

These goals range from very specific goals, such as giving up dessert at dinner, to more abstract goals, such as living a healthy lifestyle. Regardless of the type of goal, the strategies that people adopt are often maladaptive. The objective of this session is to highlight research that examines goal achievement strategies in a fresh yet rigorous manner. Together, the four papers stimulate a new understanding of when and why goal achievement strategies are effective and when they prove to be detrimental. Thus, we present some “tips and tricks” for when various strategies of goalpursuit will be optimal for goal achievement. Together, these papers suggest that often an avoidance strategy, rather than a moderation strategy, is beneficial; it can be better not to plan rather than plan out the way to achieve our goal; plans can free thoughts and attention for unrelated tasks and goals; and postponing consumption of hedonic goods can ultimately lead to decreased consumption, and thus a greater likelihood of goal achievement. Kelly Haws, Cait Poynor Lamberton, Hristina Dzhogleva and Gavan Fitzsimons begin the session by examining several potential strategies towards goal pursuit, and show that moderating, rather than eliminating, indulgence or exposure to temptation can prove to be an effective self-control strategy.

These responses were combined to create a relative moderation focus. Respondents also provided individual self-control ratings (Tangney et al. 2004) and reported their experience with a number of life outcomes–achievement of diet goals, the presence of harmful addictions, exercise, and subjective well-being. Results showed that higher selfcontrol individuals showed stronger moderation focus than did lower self-control individuals (p&lt;. 001). Importantly, individuals with a stronger moderation focus tended to achieve their diet goals, were less likely to have addiction issues, exercised more frequently, and were happier overall (all p&lt;. 05). As such, initial evidence suggests that moderation strategies may be more common and effective for higher as opposed to lower self-control consumers.

In marketing, there is growing interest in understanding these emotion regulation processes and which strategies consumers use in various situations. Research (eg, Gross 1998) has proposed five classes of emotion regulation strategies: situation selection, situation modification, attention deployment, cognitive change, and response modulation. To date, the bulk of research has focused on cognitive change and response modulation (Gross and Levenson 1993), while newer work has explored situation selection (eg, Andrade and Cohen 2007). While each of these papers contributes to a deeper understanding of emotion regulation and its psychological components, certain strategies remain under-investigated. This paper investigates attention deployment, whereby individuals strategically shift their attention toward or away from emotional stimuli to manage emotional experiences. Two studies demonstrate that people use attention shifts when presented with emotional stimuli, and a third shows that these changes in attention influence the intensity of experienced emotion, supporting an attention-based emotion regulation strategy. Two studies tested whether individuals use attention shifts to regulate emotions when they encounter emotional stimuli. To examine these strategic attention shifts, a novel paradigm was created combining attention measures with emotional experiences. Attention was indexed by participants’ accuracy as they identified rapidly presented …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Juliano Laran', 'eprint': 'http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/v38/acr_v38_16355.pdf', 'journal': 'ACR North American Advances', 'title': 'Can We Help Consumers Make Healthier Food Choices? the Role of Product Associations', 'url': 'http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/v38/acr_v38_16355.pdf', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'gkY_OTAAAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Considerable research has demonstrated that behavior is influenced by construct accessibility, and there is rapidly growing evidence suggesting that susceptibility of the self-concept to influence can determine the susceptibility of individuals to primed constructs. In this presentation, we present several studies showing effects self-related processes can have in determining whether primed constructs will affect behavior. A first factor that determines susceptibility to priming influences is the accessibility of the chronic self-concept. In the context of economic decision-making, two experiments tested whether participants with more accessible self-concept representations would be less likely to be influenced by primed constructs, but more likely to act in line with their chronic self-characteristics (Smeesters et al. 2009). Results of the first experiment showed that those who had highly accessible social value orientations acted in line with those self-representations and not with the primed constructs. Those who had less accessible social value orientations did not act in line with those self-representations, but rather acted consistently with the primed concepts. In a second experiment, the accessibility of the self-concept was manipulated. The primes affected participants whose self-concept was not made accessible by self-related words. However, when the accessibility of self-concept was increased, participants were no longer susceptible to the primed constructs. A second factor that can determine susceptibility to priming influences is private self-consciousness. Past research on this dimension has found opposite effects: some demonstrated that private …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Juliano Laran', 'eprint': 'http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/v38/acr_v38_16270.pdf', 'journal': 'ACR North American Advances', 'title': 'The Effect of Action and Inaction Goal Primes on Consumers’ Information Processing', 'url': 'http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/v38/acr_v38_16270.pdf', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'gkY_OTAAAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Four studies explore how the concept of survival unconsciously influences people‘s food choices.

One of these factors is the amount of goal pursuit an individual has engaged in (Fishbach and Dhar 2005; Kivetz, Urminsky, and Zheng 2006; Laran and Janiszewski 2009). A second factor is whether the pursuit process is focused on what has been accomplished or on what still needs to be accomplished (Zhang and Huang 2010). We explore an important determinant of people’s motivation in goal pursuit, goal valence, which may interact with factors previously explored in the literature and expand previous findings. We propose that any goal pursuit process is focused on approaching pleasure or avoiding pain, as stated by the hedonic principle (Elliot and Harackiewicz 1996; Forster, Higgins, and Idson 1998), and that this goal valence will moderate the extent to which goal focus and goal progress influence motivation. When people approach pleasure (eg, save $600 to be able to go on a cruise vacation), the goal pursuit process is motivating. Therefore, the more people look backward and focus on how much goal pursuit they have engaged in, the more motivated they are to reach the goal. When they look forward, the more there needs to be done the more motivated people are to reach the final, pleasurable end state that characterizes approaching pleasure. When people avoid pain (eg, save $600 to pay off a debt), avoiding the initial state is motivating. Therefore, the more people look backward and focus on how close they are to the initial, painful state, the more motivated they are to reach the goal.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Juliano Laran and Keith Wilcox', 'eprint': 'http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/v39/acr_v39_9804.pdf', 'journal': 'ACR North American Advances', 'title': 'Pleasure, Pain, and Focus on Initial Vs.

At the same time, luxury brands justify their high prices by offering remarkable product quality (Garfein 1989, Quelch 1987) and product quality is also a significant reason consumers purchase luxury brands (Gentry et al 2001). Despite the interest in the topic of what values consumers ascribe to a luxury brand, less understood is how such valuations may differ systematically across individuals. In the present research we examine how general intelligence (as measured by the cognitive reflection task (Frederick 2005) and the Mill Hill Vocabulary test (Raven 1981)) as well as brand knowledge affects the propensity to value luxury brands for their high quality and/or ability to signal to others. In the process of exploring this issue we uncover surprising findings as to how these individual differences influence willingness to pay for counterfeit products. In our first study we examine the relationship between intelligence and valuation of luxury brands for their signaling abilities. Both luxury products and brands as well as more mundane publicly displayed products have been shown to be particularly useful when attempting to reveal association with a reference group (Bearden and Etzel 1982).

People become more receptive to environmental influence when the source of influence is well-liked (and less receptive when the source is disliked). Moreover, people become more receptive to environmental influence when facing difficult decisions because external cues can help make decisions. Importantly, we propose that people’s receptiveness to external influence can have unintended consequences for unrelated behavioral decisions. The effect of wanting to be primed is not the same as losing self-control. Rather, we find that wanting to be primed increases indulgence when environmental cues prime “spending” but decreases indulgence when cues prime “saving.” Wanting to be primed is also different from experiencing cognitive load. Indeed, we find that wanting to be primed can reverse effects in situations where cognitive load would exacerbate them. We test our hypotheses through a combination of field and laboratory studies. To begin, we tested whether people are more receptive to priming effects when they encounter marketing stimuli that they like. In the main atrium of a university campus, where student groups and vendors set up table displays, we displayed 7 cardboard boxes (keyboard, laptop, and monitor boxes) that depicted either Dell or Apple brand logos.

For consumer behavior researchers in particular, demonstrations that environmental cues can nonconsciously influence consumer behavior (Chartrand et al. 2008) are both challenging and exciting. Challenging because a world where consumers are exposed to an ever increasing onslaught of marketing cues and primes raises the stakes for researchers trying to understand the processes by which such cues may combine and interact to influence choice and consumption. Exciting because the very idea of a parallel nonconscious goal system opens the door to new directions for research. Previously unexplained behaviors may now find resolution in the context of richer theories of consumer behavior, which recognize and integrate both conscious and nonconscious elements. In this session three papers present insights from second generation research into nonconscious influences of consumer behavior with a particular focus on improving our understanding of the mechanisms by which environmental cues can influence consumers. The papers in the session demonstrate several unexpected ways in which specific marketing-relevant primes influence behavior and explore a method for measuring/diagnosing the relevant goal activations that these primes invoke.

Although a large amount of research has been done on this topic, many important questions remain to be answered. For example, what is the role of self in self-control? Does resource depletion necessarily lead to more impulsivity? How do different definitions of self affect impulsive behavior? How does affect impact the self-control process?

While traditional research on myopic behavior suggests that a high versus low construal level leads to less indulgence, more recent work on hyperopia implies the opposite. This paper demonstrates that construal level interacts with self-focus, which jointly determines an individual’s indulgence level. Specifically, when self is not made salient, findings in the myopia literature are replicated, whereas when self is the central focus, effect reversal as predicted by the hyperopia literature is observed.

The current research investigates consumer learning environments in which cue-outcome relationships evolve overtime, starting with very simple relationships (eg, French cuisine? high quality food) and ending with more complex ones (eg, French cuisine, poor location? high quality food, poor ambiance). Of particular interest is the influence of prior learning about one benefit (eg, cuisine? quality) on predictive learning about a second benefit (eg, cuisine? ambiance) when additional predictive cues (eg, location, price point) are available, as is the case in many product categories (eg, restaurants, wine, hotels). Associative-learning theories disagree about the extent to which new learning will lead to the updating of associations between product features and product benefits. An efficient-learning hypothesis, based on the work of Mackintosh (1975), proposes that consumers will use cues (ie, features) that have been relevant before to predict new outcomes (ie, benefits). A protected-learning hypothesis (Kruschke 1996; Kruschke and Blair 2000; Kruschke et al. 2005) proposes that consumers will protect learning about cues that have been relevant before and will not use these cues to predict new outcomes.

One of the more commonly studied consumerlearning phenomena is cue competition (van Osselaer and Alba 2000; van Osselaer and Janiszewski 2001). Cue competition occurs when learning of an association between a predictive cue (eg, product attribute) and an outcome (eg, brand name) interferes with the learning about a second cue. For instance, a consumer shopping for a pain reliever may learn early in the process that a certain brand has a rapid release property and is gentle to the stomach. Later on, this consumer may learn that another brand of pain reliever has the same rapid release property (ie, a common attribute) and has antiinflammatory properties (ie, a unique attribute). Recent research on associative learning and cue interaction (Kruschke 2001a; Kruschke, Kappenman and Hetrick 2005; Medin and Edelson 1988) shows that the association between the redundant cue and the first outcome (first brand) is stronger than the association between this cue and the second outcome (eg, second brand). This phenomenon has been labeled the highlighting effect. In this paper, we use Attentional Theory (Kruschke 1996, 2001a, 2001b) to explore the marketing implications of the highlighting effect.

The present research examines how missing a task deadline may have a negative impact on motivation, and how this impact can be mitigated. People feel less productive, and report lower self-esteem and self-efficacy, after missing (vs. not missing) a task deadline (Study 1). Missing (vs. not missing) a deadline also reduces motivation to engage in the task (Study 2). Being busy mitigates the effect of missing a deadline on feelings of being less productive, which increases motivation to complete the task (Study 3). Busy people also take less time to complete a real task after missing a deadline (Study 4). Finally, data from 586,808 tasks from a popular task management software application show that once an initial task deadline has been missed, busy people tend to complete the task sooner (Study 5). These findings delineate the conditions under which missing a deadline makes people feel less productive, and how being busy mitigates these feelings and increases motivation.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Juliano Laran and Peter P Zubcsek', 'title': 'How Missing Deadlines and Being Busy Affect Productivity Keith Wilcox Columbia University Andrew T.

When consumers process at a local level, they contrast contextual standards with the target, resulting in judgment of the target as dissimilar from the contextual standard. This research demonstrates that global and local processing are not uniquely associated with a specific effect on judgment. In six studies, we demonstrate that both global and local processing can result in assimilation and contrast effects depending on the level of ambiguity of the target being evaluated. We show that when a target is ambiguous, global processing results in assimilation and local processing results in contrast. When a target is unambiguous, global processing results in contrast and local processing results in assimilation.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'JULIANO LARAN', 'eprint': 'https://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/mygsb/faculty/research/pubfiles/5891/imitation.pdf', 'title': 'KEITH WILCOX JULIANO LARAN SANKAR SEN', 'url': 'https://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/mygsb/faculty/research/pubfiles/5891/imitation.pdf'}, 'id_citations': 'gkY_OTAAAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">This paper examines how stress influences consumer saving and spending. The authors propose that consumers who experience a stressful situation allocate their resources strategically in order to gain control of their environment. A series of studies shows that this strategic allocation of resources occurs in two ways. Consumers experiencing stress may show increased saving behavior, which assures the consumer that monetary resources will be available when needed. Alternatively, consumers experiencing stress may show increased spending behavior. Spending, however, is directed specifically toward products the consumer perceives to be necessities, which are products that allow for control in an otherwise uncontrollable environment. This conceptualization and findings can inform when stress will lead to beneficial vs. impulsive consumer behaviors.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'JULIANO LARAN', 'eprint': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kristina_Durante/publication/294137875_The_Effect_of_Stress_on_Consumer_Saving_and_Spending/links/56f5630f08ae38d710a0d7f6/The-Effect-of-Stress-on-Consumer-Saving-and-Spending.pdf', 'title': 'KRISTINA M.
