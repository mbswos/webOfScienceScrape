Although the firm is better off with responsive pricing, the impact of pricing on the optimal sourcing decision and the firm\'s need for supply diversification is less clear and is dependent on factors such as unit procurement cost, supply portfolio, and supply reliability. For the case of one unreliable supplier, we show that responsive pricing mitigates the overage and underage risks imposed by yield uncertainty, and results in a lower [higher] optimal order quantity than that under ex ante pricing when the procurement cost is low [high]. For the case of one unreliable and one reliable suppliers, we find that an ex ante pricing firm finds no value in supply diversification, but responsive pricing gives rise to the need for supply diversification.

We show that a network-size-dependent base-stock/list-price policy is optimal. Interestingly, the inventory dynamics of the firm do not influence the optimal policy as long as the initial inventory is below the initial base-stock level. Hence, we can reduce the dynamic program that characterizes the optimal policy to one with a single-dimensional state-space (the network size). Network externalities give rise to the trade-off between generating current profits and inducing future demands, thus having several important implications upon the firm’s operations decisions. First, network externalities drive the firm to deliver a better service and attract more customers into the network. Hence, the safety-stock and base-stock levels are higher in the presence of network externalities. Second, the network size evolution follows a mean-reverting pattern: When the current network size is small (resp. large), it has an increasing (resp. decreasing) trend in expectation.

The key feature of our model is that the current decisions influence the future market sizes through the service effect and the network effect, ie, the firm with a higher current service level and a higher current demand is more likely to have larger future market sizes and vice versa. Hence, the competing firms face the tradeoff between generating current profits and inducing future demands (ie, the exploitation-induction tradeoff). Using the linear separability approach, we characterize the pure strategy Markov perfect equilibrium in both the simultaneous competition and the promotion-first competition. The exploitation-induction tradeoff has several important managerial implications under both competitions. First, to balance the exploitation-induction tradeoff, the competing firms should increase promotional efforts, offer price discounts, and improve service levels under the service effect and the network effect. Second, the exploitation-induction tradeoff is more intensive at an earlier stage of the sales season than at later stages, so the equilibrium sales prices are increasing, whereas the equilibrium promotional efforts and service levels are decreasing, over the planning horizon. Third, the competing firms need to balance the exploitation-induction tradeoff inter-temporally under the simultaneous competition, whereas they need to balance this tradeoff both inter-temporally and intra-temporally under the promotion-first competition.

The necessity to employ multiple suppliers arises from the fact that when an order is placed with any of the suppliers, only a random fraction of the order size is useable. The model considers a single demand season, with a given demand distribution, where all supplies need to be ordered simultaneously before the start of the season.

The PBM develops a drug benefit plan for its clients, which includes a formulary list that specifies the copayment for each branded drug, and a list of prices to be charged to the clients for each of the branded and generic drugs. Client organizations decide whether to contract with the PBM and pay the majority of drug costs, while the plan enrollees select which drug to consume. An important feature when multiple branded drugs are distributed through a common PBM is that the PBM\'s market size, measured by the number of prescriptions filled, depends on the aggregate attraction of all the drugs under the PBM\'s plan. Therefore, the branded drug manufacturers involuntarily cooperate in affecting the PBM\'s market size, while competing for the market …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Panos Kouvelis and Yixuan Xiao and Nan Yang', 'eprint': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/poms.12867', 'journal': 'Production and Operations Management', 'number': '8', 'pages': '1399-1419', 'title': 'Drug Pricing for Competing Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Distributing through a Common PBM', 'url': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12867', 'volume': '27', 'year': 2018}, 'id_citations': 'V_Qj55cAAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">We study the joint pricing and inventory management problem in the presence of online customer reviews. Customers who purchase the product may post reviews that would influence future customers\' purchasing behaviors. Under the common practice of customer-generated reviews on e-commerce platforms, rigorous investigation of their operational implications offers valuable insights and guidance for both the research community and practitioners. We develop a stochastic joint pricing and inventory management model to characterize the optimal policy in the presence of online reviews. We show that a rating-dependent base-stock/list-price policy is optimal. Interestingly, the inventory dynamics of the firm do not influence the optimal policy as long as the initial inventory is below the initial base-stock level. Hence, we can reduce the dynamic program that characterizes the optimal policy to one with a single-dimensional state-space (the aggregate net rating). The presence of online reviews gives rise to the trade-off between generating current profits and inducing future demands, thus having several important implications upon the firm\'s operations decisions. First, online reviews drive the firm to deliver a better service and attract more customers to post a review. Hence, the safety-stock and base-stock levels are higher in the presence of online reviews. Second, the evolution of the aggregate net rating process follows a mean-reverting pattern: When the current rating is low (resp. high), it has an increasing (resp. decreasing) trend in expectation. Third, although myopic profit optimization leads to significant optimality losses in the presence of …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Nan Yang and Renyu Philip Zhang', 'eprint': 'https://www.nyu.edu/projects/rzhang/DP_OnlineReview.pdf', 'journal': 'Available at SSRN 2571705', 'title': 'Dynamic Pricing and Inventory Management in the Presence of Online Reviews', 'url': 'https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2571705', 'year': 2015}, 'id_citations': 'V_Qj55cAAAAJ:RYcK_YlVTxYC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">We study a single-product assemble-to-order (ATO) system with exogenous lead times operated under a component base stock policy. The challenge of evaluating a base stock policy in an ATO system with random lead times is due to the fact that one needs to compute the distribution of the minimum of n correlated random variables, where n is the number of components. The correlation arises because the replenishment quantities of different components are all contingent on the demand for the final product. We first develop two algorithms for performance evaluation in the special case of iid lead times. The first algorithm is exponential in the number of components, but polynomial in the maximum lead time, and the second algorithm is polynomial in the number of components but exponential in the maximum lead time. We then study sequential lead times, another special case. For this case, we provide an efficient algorithm with polynomial complexity. This is the first efficient algorithm for the performance evaluation of base stock policies in an assemble-to-order system with random lead times. By using the method as an evaluation oracle in a steepest descent algorithm, we also obtain a polynomial time algorithm for base stock optimization for the case of sequential lead times. We then proceed to develop efficiently computable upper and lower bounds for the general case of exogenous lead times, which includes iid and sequential lead times as special cases. One of the two methods produces tight bounds for performance evaluation, and both bounds perform well as part of an optimization algorithm to optimize base stock levels.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'A Muharremoglu and N Yang', 'eprint': 'https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/programs/sites/programs/files/dro/DRO-2009-06.pdf', 'title': 'Decision, Risk and Operations Working Papers Series', 'url': 'https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/programs/sites/programs/files/dro/DRO-2009-06.pdf', 'year': 2009}, 'id_citations': 'V_Qj55cAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">This dissertation addresses a number of fundamental risk factors regarding the supply mechanisms in general supply chains.
