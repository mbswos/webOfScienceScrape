In 2010, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) extended eligibility for dependent coverage under private health insurance, allowing young adults to continue on family plans until age 26. The objective of this study was to analyze out-of-pocket (OOP) spending as a share of total health care expenditures for young adults with behavioral health conditions before and after the implementation of the ACA dependent care provision. The study examined the population of young adults with behavioral health conditions overall and by race and ethnicity.</div><h3 class="gsh_h3">Methods:</h3><div class="gsh_csp">The study analyzed 2008–2009 and 2011–2012 nationally representative data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey with zero-or-one inflated beta regression models in a difference-in-differences framework to estimate the impact of the ACA’s …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Mir M Ali and Jie Chen and Ryan Mutter and Priscilla Novak and Karoline Mortensen', 'eprint': 'https://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ps.201500346', 'journal': 'Psychiatric Services', 'number': '9', 'pages': '977-982', 'publisher': 'American Psychiatric Association', 'title': 'The ACA’s dependent coverage expansion and out-of-pocket spending by young adults with behavioral health conditions', 'url': 'https://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/appi.ps.201500346', 'volume': '67', 'year': 2016}, 'citedby': 10, 'id_citations': '43FP1Y0AAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '8341665369221029190', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp"><h3 class="gsh_h3">Objective.</h3><div class="gsh_csp"></div> Medicaid enrollees are more likely to use the emergency department (ED) than the privately insured and uninsured, yet little is known about enrollees’ problems in accessing primary care and specialty care providers among those needing specialty care. <h3 class="gsh_h3">Data sources.</h3><div class="gsh_csp"></div> The study sample is from the 2003–2010 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) of 2,733 Medicaid enrollees reporting a need for specialty care. <h3 class="gsh_h3">Methods.</h3><div class="gsh_csp"></div> This paper estimates a two-part model to analyze the relationship between enrollees’ access to providers and ED visits. <h3 class="gsh_h3">Principal findings.</h3><div class="gsh_csp"></div> Perceived problems accessing a primary care physician are associated with ED use among Medicaid enrollees.

More than 1.5 million people along the Gulf Coast were forced to leave their homes. 2 To help Katrina evacuees obtain health care in their new locations, the federal government coordinated with states to implement Medicaid emergency waivers. Medicaid emergency waivers are used following disasters to quickly provide short-term Medicaid insurance coverage to low-income individuals.

Unfortunately, only Reinhardt’s paper sends the right message to the hospital industry. Shactman and colleagues tell us to prepare for hospital spending increases at a rate close to that of recent years, a projection greatly in excess of recent forecasts by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). 1 But as the paper’s Exhibit 1 shows, there has been a striking degree of variation in hospital spending trends over five-to-ten-year periods, making an extrapolation from a short period (they use 1999–2001) particularly perilous. I believe that recent hospital spending trend increases largely reflect the dismantling of managed care restrictions on …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Richard Siegrist and Catherine G McLaughlin and Karoline Mortensen', 'eprint': 'https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/pdf/10.1377/hlthaff.23.1.274', 'journal': 'Health Affairs', 'number': '1', 'pages': '274-275', 'publisher': 'Project HOPE-The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.', 'title': 'The uninsured and hospital use', 'url': 'https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/abs/10.1377/hlthaff.23.1.274', 'volume': '23', 'year': 2004}, 'citedby': 1, 'id_citations': '43FP1Y0AAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '5462187479775881136', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"> <h3 class="gsh_h3">Background</h3> <div class="gsh_csp">Tattoos have reached broadening mainstream acceptance.

The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) 1 mandates that all individuals presenting to EDs in the United States receive stabilizing care for their condition, regardless of insurance status or ability to pay. 2 EDs are a unique practice setting, in that they provide a full range of medical services for any complaint, and are singularly accessible 24 hours a day, 7 days a week (Richardson and Hwang 2001). EDs have been a hot topic in the media in recent years for numerous reasons. While the number of EDs has dropped 15% over the last several years, visits to the ED have increased, and some portion of these visits are for problems that are neither emergent nor urgent (McCaig and Burt 2003). There is much debate concerning the proportion of ED visits by both the insured and uninsured that are “inappropriate”, with enormous variation across study results (Richardson and Hwang 2001).
