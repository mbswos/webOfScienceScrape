Many economic evaluations of medical practice, however, are unreliable and do not use appropriate analytic techniques. Three important trends were observed. First, two economic evaluation methods are dominant. Second, a wide range of cost estimates exists across studies. Third, a lack of standardization exists across studies with regard to basic economic evaluation principles. These findings should be considered when conducting future research, analyzing economic evaluations of breast cancer screening, and developing clinical guidelines. <h3 class="gsh_h3">CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:</h3><div class="gsh_csp"></div> Concerns about cost containment in healthcare make it necessary for physicians and clinical administrators to take an active role in resource allocation decisions at the clinical level. For instance, the recent debate on the proper age to begin annual mammography screening involves both resource allocation and clinical issues. Thus, it is important for physicians and clinical administrators to be familiar with the economic evaluation literature of breast cancer screening, economic evaluation methodology, and the associated shortcomings of published estimates.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'David W Brown and Michael T French and Maurice E Schweitzer and Kerry Anne McGeary and Clyde B McCoy and Steven G Ullmann', 'number': '1', 'pages': '28-33', 'title': 'Economic evaluation of breast cancer screening: A review.', 'url': 'https://europepmc.org/abstract/med/9893001', 'volume': '7', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 14, 'id_citations': 'aUMOyPAAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '3789100210651871384', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div><div><div class="gsh_csp">The marine dinoflagellate, <i>Karenia brevis</i>, is responsible for Florida red tides.

We introduce a set of HAB Symposium “speed” presentations and associated posters based on multi-disciplinary research.

Brevetoxins released during Kb blooms could be a reason for students experiencing increased respiratory or gastrointestinal illnesses, causing an increase in absence rates. We designed a map to relate the locations of Sarasota County schools and the distributions of those Kb counts with a minimum of 10,000 cell counts per liter and above. Due to the proximity of Kb counts, we hypothesized that brevetoxins could have a greater effect on the schools near the coast of Florida rather than the schools inland. Because individuals could be affected by brevetoxins up to several days after being exposed, we expected to find a lagged effect of a bloom occurrence on school absences. Using a regression approach, we were unable to detect an association between Kb counts and student absences. In some cases, the direction of the effects were opposite to what would be expected (i.e., an increase in Kb counts was associated with a reduction in the percent absent rate). The results indicated that over 70% of the variation in the school percent absent rate could be explained by the latent characteristics of individual schools (such as variations in student populations across different schools), by school week, by month (such as the effects of flu outbreaks or and other seasonal factors), and by year.</div></div>', 'author': 'Tamecia Moore and Roberto E Diaz and Steven G Ullmann and Porter Hoagland and Andrew R Beet and Di Jin and Barbara Kirkpatrick and Gary Kirkpatrick and Lora E Fleming and Gary Hitchcock and Michael Drennon and Naresh Kumar', 'eprint': 'https://darchive.mblwhoilibrary.org/bitstream/handle/1912/8623/Moore%20et%20al.%202015%20Kb%20and%20school%20absenteeism%20[POSTER].pdf?sequence=1', 'title': 'Testing for the potential effects of Karenia brevis on school absences [poster]', 'url': 'https://darchive.mblwhoilibrary.org/handle/1912/8623', 'year': 2015}, 'id_citations': 'aUMOyPAAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small">Karenia brevis is a marine dinoflagellate responsible for Florida red tide (FRT) blooms off the west coast of Florida. K. brevis contains brevetoxins, a neurotoxin that is absorbed by shellfish as well as released into the air. Brevetoxins are known to cause disruptions in normal neurological functions and are associated with neurotoxic shellfish poisoning (NSP). Previous research has emphasized the effect of FRT blooms on human health, from gastrointestinal to respiratory illnesses. However, there has been little research examining the effect of FRT blooms on neurological illnesses. There is research highlighting the biochemical effects of brevetoxins on mammalian nervous systems, so these symptoms can be matched to hospital codes that describe a hospital patient’s affliction. With these hospitalization codes, it is possible to study the relationship between FRT blooms and the occurrence of neurological illnesses in affected counties. The hospital data consists of inpatient data from 1988-2010 and emergency room data from 2005-2010.

Considerable efforts have been devoted to understanding the scientific aspects of HABs, including their distributions in space and time, their ecological roles, and the nature of their toxic effects, among others. Much energy also has been directed at exploring socio-economic impacts and identifying potential management actions, including actions to prevent, control, or mitigate blooms. Using blooms of Florida red tide (Karenia brevis) as a case study, we develop an approach to the choice of policy responses to K. brevis blooms. Importantly, several new types of public health, environmental, and socio-economic impacts now are beginning to be revealed, including human gastrointestinal and potential neurological illnesses; morbidities and mortalities of protected species, including manatees, cetaceans, and sea turtles; increased numbers of hospital emergency room visits for the elderly; increased respiratory morbidities in workers, such as beach lifeguards; and potential reduced K- 12 school attendance. Optimal policy responses to this hazard are likely to depend critically upon why and where a bloom occurs, its spatial and temporal scales and toxicity, and the nature of its impacts. In the face of significant ongoing scientific uncertainties, and given estimates of impacts, we find that policies to expand and stabilize scientific research programs and environmental monitoring efforts, to develop and implement education programs for both residents and tourists, and to communicate the physical aspects of blooms to the public …</div></div>', 'author': 'Porter Hoagland and Barbara Kirkpatrick and Gary Kirkpatrick and Gary Hitchcock and Steven G Ullmann and Andrew Reich and Lora E Fleming and Di Jin and Andrew R Beet and Cathy Li and Bruce Garrison and Vince Lovko and Kate Kohler and Katrin Rudge', 'title': 'CHANS: the characteristics of cost-effective policy responses for harmful algal blooms [poster]', 'url': 'https://darchive.mblwhoilibrary.org/handle/1912/8583', 'year': 2015}, 'id_citations': 'aUMOyPAAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">This study investigated newspaper coverage of Florida red tide blooms in four metropolitan areas of Southwest Florida during a 25-year period, 1987–2012.

As implied by the term “coupled,” these systems in-volve interactions between humans and nature, often affecting the dynamic characteristics of each component. Both natural and social scientists are engaged in developing a deeper un-derstanding of these dynamics, focusing on the linkages and feedbacks affecting the trajectories of coupled system behavior. Several researchers have begun to identify the generic aspects of nature-human couplings. Many of these aspects have been adapted from the field of ecology, where the dynamic characteristics of ecological systems have been studied for decades. These aspects include system heterogeneity, time lags, reciprocal feedbacks, thresholds, surprises, legacies, and resilience. The presence of such aspects has implications for the stability and persistence of particular ecosystem states, leading potentially to further implications for human heath and welfare.

Many economic evaluations of medical practice, however, are unreliable and do not use appropriate analytic techniques. Three important trends were observed. First, two economic evaluation methods are dominant. Second, a wide range of cost estimates exists across studies. Third, a lack of standardization exists across studies with regard to basic economic evaluation principles.
