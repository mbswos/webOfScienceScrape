In this chapter, I focus on two particular tools of shareholder activism, namely shareholder proposals filed under Rule 14a-8 and shareholder votes on uncontested director elections. These tools share an appealing feature. Their cost is quite modest and they do not require a significant equity stake in the company–hence, they are referred to as ‘low-cost’tools of activism. But their easy accessibility comes at a price. Both shareholder proposals and shareholder votes on director elections are essentially non-binding on the target firm, casting doubts on their effectiveness as a driver of change. Low-cost activism can be contrasted with ‘activism via large ownership’where the power to influence the firm derives from the (costly) acquisition of a significant equity stake. This equity stake can then be used to press for changes in governance and strategy (through the threat of ‘exit’or the threat of gaining control). This power may be quietly exerted behind the scenes (large shareholder activism) or in a more confrontational and public manner (eg proxy fights, hedge funds activism). 1 In the case of low-cost activism, the power to influence the firm is predicated upon the ability of the activist to build consensus among a broad spectrum of shareholders–crystallized in a symbolic, non-binding vote–and the assumption that boards will respond because ‘symbols have consequences’(Grundfest 1993), for example, in terms of reputation costs.</div><div class="gsh_csp">In view of these differences, it is important to understand the effectiveness of low-cost activism tools …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Fabrizio Ferri', 'eprint': 'http://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/mygsb/faculty/research/pubfiles/5865/lowcost_shareholder_activism.pdf', 'journal': 'Research handbook on the economics of corporate law', 'number': '9', 'publisher': 'Edward Elgar Publishing', 'title': '11.‘Low-cost’shareholder activism: A review of the evidence', 'url': 'http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=WoY_DBB5TsoC&oi=fnd&pg=PA192&dq=info:8FMDDvCrOI8J:scholar.google.com&ots=gaiqYlLjaD&sig=3rH31h6OiUs9XqFTwpXKycez4GY', 'volume': '192', 'year': 2012}, 'citedby': 48, 'id_citations': 'QsImVQ0AAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '10320187593635091440', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"> <div class="gsh_csp">We examine the effect of a change in the director election system—the switch from a plurality voting standard to a more stringent standard known as majority voting (MV).

Sections II and III review the evidence in such studies, focusing on the effect of SOP on executive pay and …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Fabrizio Ferri', 'publisher': 'Edward Elgar Publishing', 'title': 'Say on pay', 'url': 'https://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781782546849/9781782546849.00029.xml', 'year': 2015}, 'citedby': 5, 'id_citations': 'QsImVQ0AAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '6780555801859540268', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">We examine the determinants and consequences of voting outcomes at uncontested director elections. Exploiting a unique hand-collected dataset of the rationale behind proxy advisors’ recommendations—the primary driver of voting outcomes—, we document the director and board characteristics that voting shareholders focus on (as well as those that they neglect), their evolution over time and their relative importance. We find that the percentage of votes withheld from directors increases with the severity of the underlying concerns, suggesting a certain degree of informed voting. Absent a negative recommendation, high votes withheld are extremely rare, highlighting the agenda setting role of proxy advisors, arguably a greater policy concern than their influence on shareholder votes. While high votes withheld rarely result in director turnover, our analyses show that firms often respond to an adverse vote by explicitly addressing the underlying concern (as proxied for by the rationale behind the recommendation). The rate of responsiveness increases in voting dissent and varies substantially with the rationale behind the vote. Overall, it appears that shareholders use their votes in uncontested director elections to get directors to address specific problems, rather than to vote them on or off the board, but they do so only on matters highlighted by the proxy advisors.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Yonca Ertimur and Fabrizio Ferri and David Oesch', 'eprint': 'https://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/-/media/Files/Programs-and-Areas/Accounting/AcademicPapers/EFO_WHToronto.pdf', 'journal': 'Unpublished working paper.

To identify instances of activism via voting, we focus on annual meetings with at least one ballot item where a substantial fraction of shareholders is expected to vote against management’s voting recommendation, indicating an increase in their monitoring activity. We define such meetings as “contentious”. Using a sample of almost 28,000 meetings between 2003 and 2012, we examine stock returns over the period between the proxy filing and the annual meeting, when investors learn about the contentious nature of the upcoming meeting and form expectations about its likely impact on firms’ policies. We find that abnormal stock returns prior to contentious meetings are significantly positive and higher than prior to non-contentious meetings. These higher abnormal returns increase with the contentiousness of the meeting, are more pronounced in firms with poor past performance (which are more likely to respond to shareholder pressure) and persist after controlling for firm-specific news and proxies for risk factors.

One threat to this process is proxy “bundling,” or the joinder of more than one separate item into a single proxy proposal. Bundling deprives shareholders of the right to convey their views on each separate matter being put to a vote and forces them to either reject the entire proposal or approve items they might not otherwise want implemented.  In this Paper, we provide the first comprehensive evaluation of the anti-bundling rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) in 1992. While we find that the courts have carefully developed a framework for the proper scope and application of the rules, the SEC and proxy advisory firms have been less vigilant in defending this instrumental shareholder right. In particular, we note that the most recent SEC interpretive guidance has undercut the effectiveness of the existing rules, and that, surprisingly, proxy advisory firms do not have well-defined heuristics to discourage bundling.  Building on the theoretical framework, this Article provides the first large-scale empirical study of bundling of management proposals. We develop four possible definitions of impermissible bundling and, utilizing a data set of over 1,300 management proposals, show that the frequency of bundling in our sample ranges from 6.2 percent to 28.8 percent (depending on which of the four bundling definitions is used). It is apparent that bundling occurs far more frequently than indicated by prior studies.

Using a sample of almost 28,000 annual meetings between 2003 and 2012, we document a strong positive association between the degree of contentiousness of the meeting and abnormal stock returns over the 40-day period prior to the meeting. The higher abnormal returns ahead of a contentious meeting are unique to this window (ie they do not occur in the previous and subsequent 40-day window) and do not reverse after the meeting. We posit that the abnormal returns may be due to either firms’ disclosures (perhaps in an attempt to influence shareholders’ perceptions ahead of the vote) or expected governance changes after the annual meeting (in response to the vote), or both. For disclosures, we find no evidence of more positive earnings surprises, management forecast surprises, analysts’ forecast revisions or recommendations for firms facing contentious meetings. However, we find some evidence of a more positive disclosure tone in conference calls, suggesting that the abnormal returns may, at least in part, reflect soft disclosures made ahead of contentious meetings. With respect to governance, we find that firms facing contentious meetings experience a greater decrease in the entrenchment index after the meeting and that such decrease is positively associated with the abnormal returns ahead of the meeting, consistent with these returns reflecting (at least in part) expected improvements in governance after the contentious vote.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Francois Brochet and Fabrizio Ferri and Greg Miller', 'eprint': 'https://www.clsbe.lisboa.ucp.pt/pt-pt/system/files/assets/files/bfm_march2015.pdf', 'title': 'Stock Returns before Contentious Shareholder Votes', 'url': 'https://www.clsbe.lisboa.ucp.pt/pt-pt/system/files/assets/files/bfm_march2015.pdf'}, 'id_citations': 'QsImVQ0AAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC', 'source': 'citations'}]
