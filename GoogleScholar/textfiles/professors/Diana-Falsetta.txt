We examine changes in the market for tax NAS in 2002, as Congress debated possible prohibition of these services. Using the Heckman MLE procedure to control for selection bias in tax fee disclosure, we find that a strong pre-2002 positive association between tax fees and higher than expected audit fees weakened significantly in 2002, suggesting that some companies paying high audit fees reduced or terminated auditor-provided tax services in 2002. Our findings also suggest that auditor-provided tax services were reduced among new or short-tenure clients.

Although the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began requiring public companies to disclose fees paid to auditors in 2000, separate disclosure of tax service fees as a component of those fees was not required until 2003. During this period, there was increased scrutiny by the SEC on many aspects of the auditor-client relationship, and by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on the sale of tax shelters by large public accounting firms to their clients. Hence, we predict that the decisions of firms that buy tax services from their auditors to voluntarily disclose fees for those services will be significantly influenced by political costs associated with heightened regulatory scrutiny.

We run an experiment with 117 participants who allocate investment dollars between two funds of differing risk. Drawing on mental accounting and hedonic editing (; ), we posit that a tax decrease (a “gain”) implemented gradually over several years will result in a greater increase in risky investment once the decrease is fully implemented than when the tax change is implemented all at once.

We employ unique data from Italian private firms where individual auditors are cross-appointed over multiple audit engagements. By interacting over multiple engagements, auditors form ties and integrate a professional network that can be a conduit of knowledge spillover and expertise. We use network measures of centrality aggregating multiple auditors’ ties and document that firms engaging better-connected auditors exhibit comparatively lower effective tax rates. We also examine two alternative determinants of tax avoidance proposed by prior studies, auditor industry specialization and contagion of tax strategies through ties to lowtax firms. The results indicate that in our setting auditor network centrality is more important in determining clients’ levels of tax avoidance than auditor industry specialization or contagion of tax strategies. Overall, our findings suggest that individual auditors can effectively gather and spread information about tax savings strategies within their professional network.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Pietro A Bianchi and Diana Falsetta and Miguel Minutti-Meza and Eric Weisbrod', 'eprint': 'https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b673/010afb55cd789b229cbbac7d336cd1eb573b.pdf', 'pages': '1-35', 'publisher': 'University of Miami Working Paper', 'title': 'Auditor Networks and Tax Avoidance: Evidence from private firms', 'url': 'https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b673/010afb55cd789b229cbbac7d336cd1eb573b.pdf', 'year': 2014}, 'citedby': 2, 'id_citations': 'vR3OU-QAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '17293671116609170996', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">D e part m e nts building envelope (including such items as roof assemblies, windows, insulation, and weather-stripping).

While there is ample evidence on the deterrent effect of audit probability on taxpayer noncompliance, there is no evidence related to the potential role that goal congruence may have on compliance behavior. Results of our study indicate that goal congruence influences taxpayer compliance decisions, in that those with higher goal congruence (ie, greater support for how tax dollars are spent) report higher amounts of taxable income. In addition, we find that audit probability only influences taxpayer compliance decisions when there is support for the government’s use of tax dollars. When taxpayers do not support government programs, their compliance is lower regardless of the audit probability. This highlights the importance of gaining taxpayer support for government programs, and that attempts to align the goals of taxpayers with those of the government may increase voluntary compliance among taxpayers. We also examine the role that Machiavellianism, a measure of moral obligation, plays in taxpayers’ compliance decisions. We find that for certain individuals who are motivated more by self-interest (those with high Machiavellianism), a high audit rate as well as support for a program may be necessary to improve compliance behavior.
