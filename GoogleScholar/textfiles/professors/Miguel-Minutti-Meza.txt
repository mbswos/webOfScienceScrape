In our analyses, we use three audit-quality proxies—discretionary accruals, the <i>ex ante</i> cost-of-equity capital, and analyst forecast accuracy—and employ propensity-score and attribute-based matching models in attempt to control for differences in client characteristics between the two auditor groups while estimating the audit-quality effects. Using these matching models, we find that the effects of Big 4 auditors are insignificantly different from those of non-Big 4 auditors with respect to the three audit-quality proxies. Our results suggest that differences in these proxies between Big 4 and non-Big 4 auditors largely reflect client characteristics and, more specifically, client size.

After matching clients of specialist and nonspecialist auditors on a number of dimensions, as well as only on industry and size, there is no evidence of differences in commonly used audit‐quality proxies between these two groups of auditors. Moreover, there is no consistent evidence of a specialist fee premium. The matched sample results are confirmed by including client fixed effects in the main models, examining a sample of clients that switched auditors, and using an alternative proxy that aims to capture the auditor\'s industry knowledge.

Two widely used approaches to address influential observations in accounting studies are winsorization and truncation. While expedient, both depend on researcher-selected cutoffs, applied on a variable-by-variable basis, which unfortunately can alter legitimate data points. We compare the efficacy of winsorization, truncation, influence diagnostics (Cook\'s distance) and robust regression at identifying influential observations. Replication of three published accounting studies shows that the choice impacts estimates and inferences. Simulation evidence shows that winsorization and truncation are ineffective at identifying influential observations.

We do not find evidence that the regulatory change significantly affected investors’ reaction to the release of auditors’ reports, audit fees, or audit quality.

Much of the extant literature has assessed the costs and benefits of SOX to publicly traded companies. We focus on the costs of SOX compliance for private firms wanting to exit the private market via either an acquisition by a public firm or an IPO. Consistent with our predictions we establish two principal findings. First, SOX appears to have shifted the preferences of private firms from going public to exiting the private market via acquisition by a public acquirer. Second, private target deal multiples are increasing in variables that proxy for a private target\'s level of pre‐acquisition SOX compliance.

Badertscher, Jorgensen, Katz, and Kinney [2014] study the effect of auditor litigation risk on audit fees. Litigation risk is expected to be a strong incentive for auditors to deliver high quality audits and an important determinant of audit fees. Nevertheless, determining the impact of litigation risk is complicated because although there is considerable variation in audit fees, there are scarce opportunities to examine variation in litigation risk.

We focus on two dimensions of complexity that capture the volume and presentation of financial information: 10-K length and readability. We find that complexity is positively associated both with firms\' reliance on bank financing and with banks increasing their level of screening, rationing their credit supply, and imposing tighter covenants.

First, we document a trade-off between litigation and the properties of disclosure (ie, length and tone). When litigation occurs before the initial SEC filings, disclosure is comparatively longer and more pessimistic. In contrast, if litigation has not occurred, there is a negative association between the length of disclosure and subsequent litigation. Second, the length of disclosure is positively related to the likelihood of deal completion, the likelihood of an offer price increase, and the time to complete the deal.
