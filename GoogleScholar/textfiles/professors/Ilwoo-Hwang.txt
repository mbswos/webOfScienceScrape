A seller posts prices to screen a buyer over time, and the buyer may receive an outside option at a random time. We consider two information regimes: one in which the arrival of the outside option is public and one in which the arrival is private. A public arrival of the outside option works as a commitment device that forces the buyer to opt out immediately. This effect leads to a generically unique equilibrium in which the Coase conjecture holds. In contrast, a private arrival of the outside option may lead to additional delay and equilibrium multiplicity. The Coase conjecture fails in some equilibria. The buyer\'s preference about transparency is time-inconsistent: she prefers to commit to making arrivals public, but she is unwilling to disclose her outside option after the arrival. Moreover, the seller benefits from having the buyer privately …</div></div></div></div></div>', 'author': 'Ilwoo Hwang and Fei Li', 'eprint': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022053116301016', 'journal': 'Journal of Economic Theory', 'pages': '116-147', 'publisher': 'Academic Press', 'title': 'Transparency of outside options in bargaining', 'url': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022053116301016', 'volume': '167', 'year': 2017}, 'citedby': 11, 'id_citations': 'o_MokEkAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '10392232235885539385', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div><div><div class="gsh_csp">I study a dynamic one-sided-offer bargaining model between a seller and a buyer under incomplete information. The seller knows the quality of his product, while the buyer does not. During bargaining, the seller may receive an outside option, the value of which depends on the quality of the product. If the outside option is sufficiently important, there is an equilibrium in which the buyer\'s belief about the product\'s quality stays constant and she continues to make the same randomized offer throughout the bargaining process. As a result, the equilibrium behavior produces an outcome path that resembles a bargaining deadlock and its resolution. The equilibrium outcome exhibits bargaining delay that does not vanish even with frequent offers, and the limiting delay may exist even without a static adverse selection problem. Under stronger parametric assumptions, the equilibrium with deadlock is the only one in which …</div></div></div></div></div>', 'author': 'Ilwoo Hwang', 'eprint': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899825618300198', 'journal': 'Games and Economic Behavior', 'pages': '501-522', 'title': 'A Theory of Bargaining Deadlock', 'url': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899825618300198', 'volume': '109', 'year': 2018}, 'citedby': 7, 'id_citations': 'o_MokEkAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C', 'id_scholarcitedby': '14585696137001339572', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">We consider an oligopoly model in which each firm chooses not only its price but also its advertising strategy regarding how much product information to provide.

Team members receive interim feedback that is informative of their current effort levels and the project’s prospects. We show that the presence of uncertainty alleviates inefficiencies arising from free-riding. Team members exaggerate their effort to influence the interim feedback signal, which in turn, affects their partners’ beliefs about the prospects and consequently affects their future effort choices. The free-riding problem can vanish in the limit where feedback is sufficiently responsive. Our result implies that introducing uncertainty into team production can be welfare improving. Utilizing the tractability of our framework, we analyze various implications for optimal team design, such as the effects of team flexibility and asymmetric information among team members.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Doruk Cetemen and Ilwoo Hwang and Ayça Kaya', 'eprint': 'https://site.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj8706/f/teamproduction_submission_2017_4_3_site.pdf', 'title': 'Uncertainty-driven cooperation', 'url': 'https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3000269', 'year': 2017}, 'citedby': 2, 'id_citations': 'o_MokEkAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C', 'id_scholarcitedby': '1595716203571815550', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">When does an incumbent party have an incentive to experiment with a risky reform policy in the presence of future elections? To address this question, we study a dynamic game between two political parties with heterogeneous preferences and a voter. At each election, the voter chooses a party to which he gives power until the next election. Then, the incumbent chooses a policy from among a safe alternative with known payoffs or two risky ones with initially unknown expected payoffs. We show that while infrequent elections are not ideal for the voter, too frequent elections could make him even worse off. When the election frequency is low, a standard agency problem arises and the incumbent party experiments with its preferred reform policy even if its outlook is not promising. With too frequent elections, however, the incumbent stops experimentation too early because the imminent election increases the incumbent ‚Äôs potential loss of power if it undertakes risky reform. The degree of inefficiency is large enough that frequent elections are worse than a dictatorship for the voter. Efficiency could be restored if frequent elections are combined with the voter ‚Äôs strategy that advantages the incumbent party.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Ilwoo Hwang', 'title': 'Experimentation with Repeated Elections', 'url': 'https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3171239', 'year': 2018}, 'id_citations': 'o_MokEkAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">The paper considers a legislative bargaining model between an agenda setter (the president) and a legislature (congress). In each period, the president makes a policy proposal, then congress either approves or opposes it. In case of opposition, the president can attempt to change congress’ position with some probability that is a function of the president’s unobserved ability. Both congress and the president learn about the president’s ability over time, which generates the following distortions in the bargaining process: First, it may be optimal for political players to oppose policies that they like. Second, congress may be unwilling to challenge a president, which could lead the president to promote more extreme policies. We then show that these distortions can be minimized if “tough” policy issues are first on the agenda, followed by “easy” policy issues.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Ilwoo Hwang and Stefan Krasa', 'eprint': 'http://econ.msu.edu/glpetc/HwangKrasa.pdf', 'title': 'Learning in Legislative Bargaining', 'url': 'http://econ.msu.edu/glpetc/HwangKrasa.pdf', 'year': 2018}, 'id_citations': 'o_MokEkAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">This dissertation consists of three essays that study the dynamic games with incomplete information. In the first chapter, I study a dynamic trading game where a seller and potential buyers start out symmetrically uninformed about the quality of a good, but the seller becomes informed about the quality, so that the asymmetric information between the agents increases over time. The introduction of a widening information gap results in several new phenomena. In particular, the interaction between screening and learning generates nonmonotonic price and trading patterns, contrary to the standard models in which asymmetric information is initially given. If the seller\'s effective learning speed is high, the equilibrium features" collapse-and-recovery" behavior: Both the equilibrium price and the probability of a trade drop at a threshold time and then increase later. The seller\'s payoff is nonmonotonic in his learning speed, as a slower learning speed can lead to higher payoff for the seller.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Ilwoo Hwang', 'eprint': 'https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3128&context=edissertations', 'title': 'Essays on Dynamic Games of Incomplete Information', 'url': 'https://repository.upenn.edu/edissertations/1316/', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'o_MokEkAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC', 'source': 'citations'}]
