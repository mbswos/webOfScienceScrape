The scheduler has to assign the patients to time slots in such a way that she minimizes the expected weighted sum of the patients\' waiting times and the doctor\'s idle time and overtime. We first consider the static problem, where the set of patients to be scheduled and their characteristics are known in advance. We partially characterize the optimal schedule and introduce a new sequencing rule that schedules patients according to a single index that is a function of their characteristics. Then we apply our theoretical results and conclusions from numerical experiments to sequential scheduling procedures. We propose a heuristic solution to the sequential scheduling problem, where requests for appointments come in gradually over time and the …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Christos Zacharias and Michael Pinedo', 'eprint': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/poms.12065', 'journal': 'Production and Operations Management', 'number': '5', 'pages': '788-801', 'title': 'Appointment scheduling with no‐shows and overbooking', 'url': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/poms.12065', 'volume': '23', 'year': 2014}, 'citedby': 125, 'id_citations': 'fdVYL94AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C', 'id_scholarcitedby': '16805662692188762797', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Patients nationwide experience difficulties in accessing medical care in a timely manner due to long backlogs of appointments. Medical practices aim to utilize their valuable resources efficiently, deliver timely access to care, and at the same time they strive to provide short waiting times for patients present at the medical facility. We address the <i>joint</i> problem of determining the panel size of a medical practice and the number of offered appointment slots per day, so that patients do not face long backlogs and the clinic is not overcrowded. We explicitly model the two time scales involved in accessing medical care: appointment delay (order of days, weeks) and clinic delay (order of minutes, hours). Closed-form expressions are derived for the performance measures of interest based on diffusion approximations. Our model captures many features of the complex reality of outpatient care, including patient no-shows …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Christos Zacharias and Mor Armony', 'eprint': 'https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/mnsc.2016.2532', 'journal': 'Management Science', 'number': '11', 'pages': '3978–3997', 'publisher': 'http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.2016.2532', 'title': 'Joint Panel Sizing and Appointment Scheduling in Outpatient Care', 'url': 'https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.2016.2532', 'volume': '63', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 36, 'id_citations': 'fdVYL94AAAAJ:hMod-77fHWUC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '9567359967126524738', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"> <div class="gsh_csp">Scheduling plays an important role in many different service industries. In this paper we provide an overview of some of the more important scheduling problems that appear in the various service industries. We focus on the formulations of such problems as well as on the techniques used for solving those problems. We consider five areas of scheduling in service industries, namely (i) project scheduling, (ii) workforce scheduling, (iii) timetabling, reservations, and appointments, (iv) transportation scheduling, and (v) scheduling in entertainment. The first two areas are fairly general and have applications in many different service industries. The third, fourth and fifth areas are more related to some very specific service industries, namely the hospitality and health care industries, the transportation industries (of passengers as well as of cargo), and the entertainment industries.

Recursive and explicit expressions for the performance measures of interest are derived based on the random evolution of the system’s workload in transient state.

These systems provide an alternative and sustainable mean of transportation to the city dwellers. Apart from the energy sustainability benefits, shared bike systems can have a positive effect on residents’ health, air quality and the overall condition of the currently crumbling road network infrastructure. Anecdotal stories and survey studies have also identified that bike lanes have a positive impact on local businesses. In this study, driven by the rapid adoption of shared bike systems by city governments and their potential positive effects on a number of urban life facets we opt to study and quantify the value of these systems. We focus on a specific aspect of this value and use evidence from the real estate market in the city of Pittsburgh to analyze the effect on dwellers’ properties of the shared bike system installed in the city in June 2015. We use quasi-experimental techniques and find that the shared bike system led to an increase in the housing prices (both sales and rental prices) in the zip codes where shared bike stations were installed. We further bring into the light potential negative consequences of this impact (i.e., gentrification) and discuss/propose two public policies that can exploit the impact of the system for the benefit of both the local government as well as the city dwellers.</div></div>', 'author': 'Konstantinos Pelechrinis and Christos Zacharias and Marios Kokkodis and Theodoros Lappas', 'eprint': 'https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0184092', 'journal': 'PloS one', 'number': '8', 'pages': 'e0184092', 'publisher': 'Public Library of Science', 'title': 'Economic impact and policy implications from urban shared transportation: The case of Pittsburgh’s shared bike system', 'url': 'https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0184092', 'volume': '12', 'year': 2017}, 'citedby': 11, 'id_citations': 'fdVYL94AAAAJ:vV6vV6tmYwMC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '15766287507614848191', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">We address the problem of designing appointment scheduling strategies in a stochastic environment accounting for patient no-shows, non-punctuality, general stochastic service times, and unscheduled emergency walk-ins. A good appointment schedule seeks to help outpatient clinics to utilize their resources efficiently while containing patients\' waiting times. The task of identifying an optimal schedule is modeled as a nonlinear integer program, where the objective function is the outcome of stochastic analysis in transient state. We maintain the discrete nature of the appointment scheduling problem by considering arrival epochs with discrete supports. By looking at discrete-time snapshots of the random evolution of a single-server queueing model, we characterize probabilistically the system\'s workload over time as a function of an appointment schedule and we derive recursive expressions for the performance measures of interest. Subsequently, we unfold discrete convexity properties of the optimization problem. We prove that under general conditions the objective function is supermodular and componentwise convex. Under assumptions on patient punctuality, we prove that the optimal scheduling strategy minimizes a multimodular function; a property which guarantees that a locally optimal schedule is also globally optimal. The size of the local neighborhood, however, grows exponentially with the dimension of the problem. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to develop and implement an algorithm for minimizing locally a multimodular function over nonnegative integer vectors via submodular set-function minimization over ring …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Christos Zacharias and Tallys Yunes', 'eprint': 'http://moya.bus.miami.edu/~czacharias/folder/ZachariasYunes2018.pdf', 'journal': 'Management Science', 'pages': 'Forthcoming', 'publisher': 'http://moya.bus.miami.edu/~czacharias/folder/ZachariasYunes2017.pdf', 'title': 'Multimodularity in the Stochastic Appointment Scheduling Problem with Discrete Arrival Epochs', 'url': 'https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3273649', 'year': 1970}, 'citedby': 3, 'id_citations': 'fdVYL94AAAAJ:YFjsv_pBGBYC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '15262978544871925545', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">As a PhD student at NYU Stern, I came across the enterprise of developing a heavy traffic diffusion limit for a single server queue with finite waiting room.
