In this paper we provide an overview of the existing literature on customer experience and expand on it to examine the creation of a customer experience from a holistic perspective. We propose a conceptual model, in which we discuss the determinants of customer experience. We explicitly take a dynamic view, in which we argue that prior customer experiences will influence future customer experiences. We discuss the importance of the social environment, self-service technologies and the store brand. Customer experience management is also approached from a strategic perspective by focusing on issues such as how and to what extent an experience-based business can create growth. In each of these areas, we identify and discuss important issues worthy of further research.</div></div></div></div></div>', 'author': 'Peter C Verhoef and Katherine N Lemon and Ananthanarayanan Parasuraman and Anne Roggeveen and Michael Tsiros and Leonard A Schlesinger', 'eprint': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022435908000845', 'journal': 'Journal of retailing', 'number': '1', 'pages': '31-41', 'publisher': 'JAI', 'title': 'Customer experience creation: Determinants, dynamics and management strategies', 'url': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022435908000845', 'volume': '85', 'year': 2009}, 'citedby': 1997, 'id_citations': 'BR85Rt4AAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '13225376466770582127', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Instead of offering products or services alone, increasingly, firms and their partners are offering consumption systems. Consumption systems are offerings characterized by a significant product and service subsystem, as well as a pattern of consumption in which consumption occurs in multiple episodes over time. The authors develop a theoretical model for conceptualizing satisfaction with consumption systems and empirically test it using longitudinal data from 5206 automobile owners. Results show that an intertemporal examination of attribute-level performance, satisfaction, and behavioral intentions can improve an understanding of their relationships because these relationships change as the consumption of the product unfolds. For example, on the basis of their salience, attribute weights in determining satisfaction shift over time.

Disconfirmation and responsibility jointly determine the valence component, and stability determines the expectancy component of the satisfaction evaluation.

In doing so, it dissects the evaluation process and examines both the antecedents and consequences of the service encounter evaluation. Using theories from the extant consumer behavior and services literatures, the framework provides a more detailed and comprehensive picture of the evaluation process (eg, it distinguishes between routine and non-routine encounters, between encounters involving core-and support-service providers, etc.).

To explain this puzzle, we identify an averaging heuristic whereby individuals rely on the arithmetic average of a quantity when summarizing a set of ratios, even though the quantity appears in the denominator of these ratios. This amounts to a tendency to incorrectly average denominators, and leads to systematically inaccurate inferences. To provide evidence for the usage of the averaging heuristic we first present the theoretical foundation for the link between the heuristic and the undervaluation of stocks with high idiosyncratic volatility. We then use 26 years of US stock market data to (i) replicate the positive relation between idiosyncratic volatility and risk-adjusted returns,(ii) show that ability (operationalized as analyst coverage and institutional ownership) moderates this relation and (ii) empirically rule out a riskbased explanation of the puzzle. Finally, we provide more direct evidence for the use of the averaging heuristic in two lab experiments by showing that participants make stock investment decisions and evaluate fundamental stock values in a manner consistent with the averaging heuristic. We also confirm with experimental data the role of ability as a boundary condition for the effect of the heuristic and present process evidence supporting our claims.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'H Chen and Alina Sorescu and Sorin Sorescu and Michael Tsiros', 'eprint': 'http://cfdmc.colorado.edu/2010/Submissions/Conversation%20Starter%20Session1/Session1_Chen_Yes%20-%2006-18-2010%201342.pdf', 'journal': 'Texas A&M University.

A customer who is delayed due to bad weather simply receives an explanation for the delay; whereas a customer who is delayed due to overbooking receives a travel voucher. But for which failures is each response appropriate? In other words, in which situations is explanation alone sufficient as a recovery effort and under which conditions is compensation also necessary?

While, conventional wisdom suggests that this practice leads to negative consumer evaluations of brand quality, a series of field experiments reveal negative effects on brand quality perceptions only among loyal consumers and those who perceive low risk associated with perishables. The effect is also mediated by consumer distrust (Study 1). In addition, EDBP has no effect on brand quality image if consumers are already familiar with this pricing practice (Study 2), and it may even generate positive consumer evaluations when framed as a cause-related marketing activity to reduce waste (Study 3).

In general, motion generates a sense of aesthetic excitement and interest (Freyd 1993). In line with this, logos comprised of dynamic images typically increase consumer engagement. They may also lead to more favorable brand evaluations if there is a perception of fit between the associations of motion and brand characteristics. Specifically, Luca, Krishna, and Elder (2014) demonstrate that dynamic logos lead to more favorable brand attitudes than static logos when paired with modern (as opposed to traditional) brands, and this effect is driven by a perception of fit between motion and modernization. Beyond this, little is known about the downstream consequences of utilizing dynamic logos. In this research, we examine the effect of logo dynamism in the context of self-control dilemmas. We propose that the perception of motion in a logo triggers thoughts of the future. Consumers generally exhibit an optimism bias, such that they associate the future with an increase in their well-being. We hypothesize that this perceived increase in their future well-being will lead consumers to indulge more in the present. This suggests that dynamic logos will increase the consumption of vices.

One design feature that has received little attention is the use of frames. Yet, a significant number of brands feature a frame surrounding their logo (eg Smucker’s, Leap Frog). In fact, as of December 2013, 8.84% of American corporations listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and classified as members of the consumer goods or service industries used a framed brand logo.

This alternative strategy requires that the seller offer one or more additional discounts that are less than the prior discount before returning the product to its original price. Here, we investigate whether sellers should return prices to their pre-promotion levels all at once or in steps. Theoretically, we assess how consumers’ future price expectations and their anticipated regret influence their likelihood to buy. Three studies suggest that SDD may be an effective alternative strategy for sellers and that consumers’ future price expectations and anticipated regret drive their likelihood to buy.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Michael Tsiros and David Hardesty', 'journal': '2005 FORDHAM UNIVERSITY BEHAVIORAL PRICING CONFERENCE', 'pages': '26', 'title': 'STEADY DECREASING DISCOUNTS', 'url': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pelin_Bicen/publication/312808969_Consumer_Perceptions_of_Quality_Risk_and_Value_A_Conceptual_Framework/links/5b65edd6aca2724c1f22f1e3/Consumer-Perceptions-of-Quality-Risk-and-Value-A-Conceptual-Framework.pdf#page=34', 'year': 2005}, 'id_citations': 'BR85Rt4AAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Retailers, such as Starbucks and Victoria\'s Secret, aim to provide customers a great experience across channels. In this paper we provide an overview of the existing literature on customer experience and expand on it to examine the creation of a customer experience from a holistic perspective. We propose a conceptual model, in which we discuss the determinants of customer experience. We explicitly take a dynamic view, in which we argue that prior customer experiences will influence future customer experiences. We discuss the importance of the social environment, self-service technologies and the store brand. Customer experience management is also approached from a strategic perspective by focusing on issues such as how and to what extent an experience-based business can create growth. In each of these areas, we identify and discuss important issues worthy of further research.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Leonard A Schlesinger and Peter C Verhoef and Katherine N Lemon and A Parasuraman and Anne Roggeveen and Michael Tsiros', 'title': 'Customer Experience Creation', 'url': 'https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=45305', 'year': 2005}, 'id_citations': 'BR85Rt4AAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'author': 'M Tsiros', 'pages': '342-342', 'publisher': 'ASSOC CONSUMER RESEARCH', 'title': 'The role of regret in post choice valuation: When choice sets consist of more than two alternatives', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7428513763466968412&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'volume': '26', 'year': 1999}, 'id_citations': 'BR85Rt4AAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'author': 'Michael Tsiros', 'pages': '0993-0993', 'title': 'Incorporating regret in a multiple reference-point model for conceptualizing satisfaction and predicting termination in an exchange relationship.', 'url': 'http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5103589940124464989&hl=en&oi=scholarr', 'year': 1970}, 'id_citations': 'BR85Rt4AAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">The article develops a model of regret and tests it via four studies. Study 1 develops a multi-item measure of regret and distinguishes it from satisfaction. It also shows that, while satisfaction directly influences both repurchase and complaint intentions, regret directly influences only repurchase intentions, and its effect on complaint intentions is fully mediated via satisfaction. Study 2 examines the antecedents and moderators of regret. It shows that regret is experienced even in the absence of information on a better-forgone outcome. Furthermore, the moderating effect of three situation-specific characteristics (outcome valence, status quo preservation, and reversibility of the outcome) is exarnined. Studies 3 and 4 examine the cognitive process underlying the experiencing of regret in the absence of information on a better-forgone outcome. Generation of counterfactuals is identified as the cognitive mechanism that …</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Michael Tsiros and Vikas Mittal', 'eprint': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael_Tsiros/publication/24099041_Regret_A_Model_of_Its_Antecedents_and_Consequences_in_Consumer_Decision_Making/links/00b495231baf47f556000000/Regret-A-Model-of-Its-Antecedents-and-Consequences-in-Consumer-Decision-Making.pdf', 'title': 'Regret: A Model of Its Antecedents and Consequences in Consumer Decision', 'url': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael_Tsiros/publication/24099041_Regret_A_Model_of_Its_Antecedents_and_Consequences_in_Consumer_Decision_Making/links/00b495231baf47f556000000/Regret-A-Model-of-Its-Antecedents-and-Consequences-in-Consumer-Decision-Making.pdf'}, 'id_citations': 'BR85Rt4AAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">Review of Marketing Research, now in its 11th volume, has emerged as an important publication covering the areas of marketing research with a more comprehensive state-of-the-art orientation.
