Although the United States is clearly an outlier, almost all of the additional increase in US HCE happened during the 1978–1990 period. We perform two growth accounting exercises to explore sources of variability of HCE over GDP across countries. In the first growth accounting exercise based on value added we find that factor accumulation is unable to replicate the observed growth patterns. We also show that the additional increase in markups in the US corporate medical sector mimics well the ratio of HCE over GDP in the United States. This suggests that differences in the relative price of health care—rather than technology, product quality, and factor accumulation—could explain the divergent growth patterns of HCE over GDP across these countries.

In this paper we show that a specific cognitive bias, the availability heuristic, can exacerbate pricing errors in an environment with asymmetric information and out-of-town buyers. When people use the availability heuristic, they make their judgments based on the most salient, rather than the most relevant information. Through studying Arizona’s market for ranchettes, small ranches located near main urban areas, we find that non-Arizona buyers who purchase ranchettes earn smaller returns than Arizona buyers. Furthermore, we find that there is also a difference in realized returns between different non-Arizona buyers that is related to variations in the natural landscape at the time they visit the prospective property. As such, we find that non-Arizona buyers base their predictions about amenities on the observations they made while visiting, even when these observations are not representative.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Alex R Horenstein and Daniel Osgood and Avichai Snir', 'eprint': 'http://www.alexhorenstein.com/uploads/5/8/7/2/58721379/housing_heuristics_2016_final.pdf', 'journal': 'Real Estate Finance', 'title': 'Out-of-town Buyers, Mispricing and the Availability Heuristic in a Housing Market', 'url': 'https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2942808', 'year': 2017}, 'citedby': 2, 'id_citations': 'IMeDr_cAAAAJ:5ugPr518TE4C', 'id_scholarcitedby': '9873506362603659884', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">The analysis presented here uses simulated and real data sets to investigate the relative merits of parametric, semi-parametric and Bayesian methods in testing for the co-existence of plottage and plattage and in identifying the inflection point.

Flippers purchase properties discounted an average of 7% in the market. This discount reflects the ability of flippers to identify underpriced properties which supports the information advantage story. When using all-cash purchases, the price is further discounted 12% and properties purchased at foreclosure are discounted an additional 20% for a total discount of 39%.

This paper provides a theoretical explanation for this empirical finding. For an economy where the portfolios on the mean-variance frontier are well-diversified ones and the market portfolio of stocks is also a well-diversified one (regardless of whether it is mean-variance efficient or not), we show that the market betas become unitary when the Capital Asset Pricing Model is augmented with the common factors in the space of excess returns. Consequently, the market betas have no power to explain the cross-sectional dispersion of expected stock returns. Based on this finding, we propose an alternative method that can identify the relevant factors for asset pricing. Specifically, we show that the relevant factors can be extracted by the principal components from a large set of excess stock returns over the market return if the market portfolio is a well-diversified one. Analyzing US data on individual and portfolio stock returns, we develop a benchmark model with five principal component factors. We use the model to study if the five-factor model of Fama and French (2015) captures all the relevant information to span the space of excess returns.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Seung C Ahn and Alex R Horenstein', 'eprint': 'http://www.alexhorenstein.com/uploads/5/8/7/2/58721379/ah_vw_excess_returns.pdf', 'journal': 'Available at SSRN 2942537', 'title': 'Asset pricing and excess returns over the market return', 'url': 'https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2942537', 'year': 2019}, 'citedby': 1, 'id_citations': 'IMeDr_cAAAAJ:bnK-pcrLprsC', 'id_scholarcitedby': '4972582653290121795', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">In this paper we study why people fail at backward induction.

The ﬁrst objective is to explore what mobile technology has to oﬀer for experimental research. To that end, a team of app developers was recruited to create Blues and Reds, a mobile app (Android/iOS) that operates as an experiment designed to study behavior in dynamic games. In less than six months, the app generated a database consisting of 35,826 observations from 6,463 subjects located in 141 countries. The second objective is to design and test a novel method of proﬁling players in dynamic games using data from Blues and Reds that satisﬁes both descriptive and predictive requirements. To describe the reasoning process in dynamic games, a proﬁle consists of two dimensions. The ﬁrst dimension depicts the quality of the subject’s reasoning (savvy vs naive); the second dimension captures the speed of that reasoning (fast vs slow). Predictive power requires that the subject’s proﬁle indicates her likelihood to behave consistently with backward induction. The proposed hypothesis is that this probability is the highest for savvy-fast proﬁle, followed by savvy-slow, then naive-fast, and naive-slow at the end. This hypothesis is successfully conﬁrmed and replicated in 22 various dynamic games.</div></div></div>', 'author': 'Konrad Grabiszewski and Alex R Horenstein', 'eprint': 'http://www.alexhorenstein.com/uploads/5/8/7/2/58721379/profiling.pdf', 'journal': 'Available at SSRN 3397768', 'title': 'Proﬁling Players in Dynamic Games: A Mobile Experiment', 'url': 'https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3397768', 'year': 2019}, 'id_citations': 'IMeDr_cAAAAJ:JoZmwDi-zQgC', 'source': 'citations'}, {'_filled': True, 'bib': {'abstract': '<div class="gsc_vcd_value" id="gsc_vcd_descr"><div class="gsh_small"><div class="gsh_csp">This paper studies the factor structure in the cross-section of delta-hedged equity option returns.

Factor analysis is a natural approach to estimate such models. Given that the factors are variables the econometrician does not observe directly, two fundamental questions arise when analyzing factor models: what are these factors and how many of them there are. Various estimators for the number factors exist, but they can be problematic. Previous estimators, for example, require the use of an ad hoc penalty function. This dissertation develops two new estimators, which do not require ad hoc penalty function, for determining the number of factors (r) in approximate factor models when using large panels of data.
